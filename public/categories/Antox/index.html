<p>The Login activity has been changed to be given a nice background. Also, instead of having to write the name of your profile, the text box has been swapped for a dropdown list of all the profiles you have created to make logging in a much simpler and quicker process.</p>

    	<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">There seems to be a problem of crashing when registering (both skipping and not skipping). I’d recommend not upgrading just yet and I’ll try and get it fixed by the end of the week. Sorry for the wait</span></p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve written a blog post for a release of Antox but I felt with the major changes in this version, it would be best if I did.</p>
<p>The major change in this release which may cause confusion is the introduction of an account system. When you create an account, it assigns the account a new tox id as well as its own friends list and chat logs, so that you can easily create and manage multiple identities from the same application. You just logout of one account, and login to another to swap tox id’s. No hassle in dragging tox save files about. It also takes the account name and registers it on <a href="https://toxme.se" target="_blank" rel="external">https://toxme.se</a> so that others can add you using just the account name. If you don’t want to be signed up on toxme, you should tick “skip registration” in the registration screen. I’ve taken these steps to try and make the application extremely easy to use. Regular users are used to creating accounts and having people add that account name and this is what I’m trying to emulate for tox. Hopefully others like the changes I’ve made and that other clients follow so that the experience is the same across all platforms.</p>
<p>Some other notable changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicer looking tabs in the main section</li>
<li>You can now accept and reject file transfers</li>
<li>File transfer speed is now displayed</li>
<li>Better ordering and searching of the contacts list</li>
<li>The Tox ID can now be found under the ‘Advanced’ tab of Settings<br>We will soon have A/V in antox as well. The functions have already been wrapped in jToxCore and are just being proof-read as we speak to make sure it’s correct. Once merged and ready, audio is the first function I want to get into antox.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit: </strong>If you tick “skip registration” an account name is still required so that multiple tox id’s can be used. It uses the account name you entered as the file name for the tox save so that when you login, it loads the appropriate tox id</p>

    	<p>A new version of Antox has been released with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter the friends list by groups e.g. Online, Offline.</li>
<li>You can now block friends so that you no longer receive messages or friend requests from them. As well as this, neither of you will see each other come online.</li>
<li>Friends can now be added using the Tox DNS Discovery Version 1 and Version 2. For more information, see the <a href="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/182/introducing-sts-single-tox-standard" target="_blank" rel="external">STS</a>. This is a very technical feature at the moment but in the feature it will mean you can add each other with usernames once some more things have been ironed out.</li>
<li>You can manually set your language in the settings window should the default language picked for you by Android not suffice.</li>
<li>A Russian translation has been added to Antox.</li>
<li><p>Improved and more efficient backend to help reduce network connection issues<br><strong>Still to come in new releases</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing indicators and a welcome tour (I promised these in the last blog post)</p>
</li>
<li>Ability to create custom groups which you can then assign friends to<br><strong>Antox is now on F-Droid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the last release, you can now get Antox on F-Droid by adding <a href="http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo" target="_blank" rel="external">http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo</a> to your repo list. To do this, go to ‘Manage Repos’ in F-Droid. These will only be updated with every major release (or when a bug is fixed) rather than with every slight change.</p>

    	<p>We realized after many people complained that the way we currently use to develop Tox is wrong. C is the worst language to develop a lightweight skype replacement in. Compared to modern languages like C#, JavaScript and Java, C is an old and deprecated language only used by old men with long beards who refuse to update their old MSDOS machines to the much better and modern Windows 8.1. In order to become a popular application, Tox must be built with modern tools and not languages like C that belong in a museum.</p>
<p>We have decided to rewrite Tox in JavaScript, this will enable us to make use of advanced web frameworks and base our application on advanced libraries such as WinJS and Node.js in order to create the best user experience possible.</p>
<p>We have listened to those who say we have been re inventing the wheel and pledge to never do it again. As such we will only use proven libraries for the functionality Tox needs.</p>
<p>Tox will now use i2p for the peer finding, this will also enable you to connect anonymously to other peers. For the networking we will use the very popular C++ Boost libraries to boost our application to a next level of performance and portability. Instead of NaCl (a relatively unknown crypto library) Tox will use OpenSSL, the standard library for secure communication on the internet. Instead of stupidly using the audio and video encoders and decoders directly, Tox will now use WebRTC for audio and video communications. Because of this, Tox will now be compatible with web browsers. Instead of the relatively new and untested ECC cryptography, Tox will now use good old RSA and AES for encryption. We will now use 512 bit RSA keys that are much stronger than the weak 256 bit ECC keys Tox uses right now. Tox will now use namecoin so that everyone can have a unique username which will increase ease of use by large amounts and solve one of the biggest issues that people have been having with current Tox.</p>
<p>A huge issue that current Tox has is that it fails to sync conversations across devices, we will solve this by using facebook. Using facebook we can securely store the contents of all conversations and your contacts in a location that can be accessed using an extremely secure https connection from anywhere. This will also prevent murderers, terrorists, racists, pedophiles, privacy activists and other people that could hurt the image of Tox from using it for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the user interface, the official Tox clients will include buttons so that users can share the contents of their conversations on free social networking websites such as reddit and twitter.</p>
<p>A significant amount of resources will be spent to create a Tox client that works entirely in the cloud. Tox will now be usable by anyone with a web browser and a facebook account. We now truly see that the browser is the future and that applications running natively on the desktop will soon disappear completely. We had previously though web clients could not be secure but realized that we were wrong. Encrypting things browser side with JavaScript served from a central web server is much more safe than using unsafe languages like C.</p>
<p>To finance our operations, some advertisements will be added to every Tox client, the only way to disable them will be to compile Tox manually from source which will be very hard to do because we plan to soon remove the bloated build systems from every client.</p>
<p>I must also warn you that we will not be using git or github to develop this new version of Tox. Git is a creation of Linus Torvalds, a very backwards man who thinks that object oriented programming is very bad and who hates modern safe languages like C++ and Java. Since we don’t agree with him, we cannot in good faith use anything he is the CEO of. Therefore and also to promote synergy between our many developers, we have also decided to migrate our version control system to CVS. CVS has the advantage of forcing people to talk more about their pull request, thus streamlining our communications. We are sure this paradigm shift will help us push the envelope on Tox development.</p>
<p>We understand that this is a huge change for Tox however we believe this is for the best.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued support,</p>
<p>Project Tox.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: This was posted on April 1 and as such should not be taken seriously.</strong></p>

    	<p>We’ve finally arrived at a new version of Antox after a period of slow development. With this release comes two new major features, as well as a myriad of small bug fixes and slight changes not worth mentioning.</p>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Your friends now have profiles, just long hold on them to access it. The profiles contain all your friend’s information including a QR image of their Tox key for easier sharing amongst your social group.</li>
<li><p>You can now give your friends nicknames/aliases to easier identify your friend. This can be set when adding them for the first time, and later updated in their profile. Clearing their alias altogether will return to displaying their Tox nickname.<br><strong>Upcoming Features in the Next Release</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing indicators to show when your friends are writing to you. You’ll also send a typing status to your friends. These indicators will be a setting so you can turn them off should you wish to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>Manually set your language. Currently you will be shown translated strings automatically if they exist based upon your locale, however to give you more control a setting will also be added to let you change the language.</li>
<li>Welcome Tour to show off all the Antox features and gently introduce new users to Tox itself.</li>
<li>Continued effort like always to fix the disconnects and any crashes.<br>You can get the updated APKs as always from <a href="http://download.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></li>

    	<p>You can now finally get up to date Antox releases on the <a href="http://wiki.tox.im/binaries" target="_blank" rel="external">Tox Downloads</a> page. These APKs are updated automagically every time there’s a change to Antox or the Tox core, which is usually several times a day.</p>
<p>This comes just in time as unfortunately we’ve had to pull Antox from the Google Play Store Alpha. This is due to a technical mishap with our key signing. Check back here and the current Google+ group for more news on how we fix this.</p>
<p>Lastly as a small note, you can now get bitcoins for your commits to Antox thanks to anonymous doners on <a href="http://tip4commit.com/projects/654" target="_blank" rel="external">tip4commit</a>.</p>

    	<p>Let’s just rename this blog to the Antox development blog.</p>
<p>Antox 0.6.5 is out and, like yesterday, with only minor changes that are mostly cosmetic. The total changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change receipt icons to something less arbitrary</li>
<li>Updated Italian translation</li>
<li>Updated German translation</li>
<li>Add Turkish translation</li>
<li>Timestamps of messages now update based on the local time of your device</li>
<li>Antox now waits to fully load the database information before accepting input. This may result in about a 1 second delay in starting the app, but it prevents force closing by a user interacting too quickly.</li>
<li>Deleted chat threads are now removed from the interface immediately<br>That’s it for today! Unfortunately, Google’s Developer Console seems to be down so it might take awhile. If you want to see the changes immediately without having to wait, you can download the<a href="http://vexx.us/Clients/Antox/antox-0.6.5.apk" target="_blank" rel="external"> APK here.</a> The update is signed with the same keys used for Google Play, which means it can’t be spoofed.</li>
</ul>
