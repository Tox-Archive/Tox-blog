    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you may have noticed, your Tox client received an update.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<h2 id="New_API">New API</h2>
<p>After almost a month of blocking updates we finally pushed a major change that might have caused some issues with your friends. The new API was a major refactor and improvement in the protocol and the public API, resulting in issues with old API clients.</p>
<p>To transition smoothly we blocked most updates so clients and other software could be updated to work with our changes, and when we felt this was done the flood gates were re-opened.</p>
<p>If you haven‚Äôt already, please update your client and instruct your friends to do the same and you should be back to Toxing without interruption.</p>
<h2 id="GSoC">GSoC</h2>
<p>After over a month of work reading proposals, talking to students, and debating on the best of the best we‚Äôve come to a conclusion and decided on the 9 best students we could.</p>
<p>Students were evaluated on proposals, how much they fit with what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish with Tox, and how much we thought they had a genuine interest in helping open source.</p>
<p>With over 90 proposals from many amazing students from a wide variety of backgrounds, choosing 9 special few for this year‚Äôs GSoC was one of the most difficult decisions we‚Äôve had to make all year and we hope we chose well.</p>
<p>Want to know who got selected? This is published on the <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/tox" target="_blank" rel="external">Melange</a>.</p>
<p>Did you get selected? Join us in <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23tox-gsoc-students" target="_blank" rel="external">#tox-gsoc-students</a> and get to meet your mentors if you haven‚Äôt already.</p>
<p>Did you not get selected? Many of you submitted amazing proposals that we wish we could have selected but didn‚Äôt have the mentors or resources to do so. We‚Äôd greatly appreciate it if you‚Äôd continue to contribute to Tox or any other open source project that you find interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Tox Foundation has made an important discovery today that might change the world forever.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Our research team at the Tox foundation has made an important discovery today. Data packets travel at the speed of light meaning finding a way to make them travel slightly faster is not that hard. The trick is to make the wire itself go fast in order to transmit the data inside at faster than light speeds. The following diagram should explain very well how it works.</p>
<img src="/images/Tox_ftl.png">

<p>Faster than light information travel allows us to send information back and forward in time by tweaking the packet parameters.</p>
<p>I managed to communicate with myself from the future and this is what I managed to understand. The connection was very flaky because of the dimensional noise created when someone interferes with his past. Here is the news from the future:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.tox.im/2015/04/01/introducing-toxcoin" target="_blank" rel="external">Toxcoin</a> died a slow death after not a single developer was found that wanted to develop it.</p>
<p>qTox is doing very well competing with other web browsers.</p>
<p>uTox was rewritten in javascript and became a web client.</p>
<p>Toxic was acquired by Microsoft and ported to Windows, it will soon be replacing Skype.</p>
<p>Antox was slowly replaced by uTox for android.</p>
<p>nTox is still alive.</p>
<p>I also received this image but can‚Äôt make sense of it.</p>
<img src="/images/Tox_ftl_message.jpg">


<p>The connection was then cut suddenly. I will try to find out why the connection cut and why I can‚Äôt seem to be able to contact the future anymore.</p>
<p>Happy Future Toxing.</p>
<p>In other news it has been reported to us that Tox works from a helicopter.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tox development preview for Chrome OS</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>With the advent of the Chromebook, the face of modern computing<br>changed in a number of drastic ways. Super low cost but fully<br>usable machines with browsers, chat programs, and full office<br>suites became available to even the lowest income students.</p>
<p>These devices let users shift from low budget bottom of the<br>barrel laptops often times filled to the brim in spyware and<br>adware to light and responsive machines boasting great battery<br>life and access to services they already use, something that<br>can only be looked at as a win for consumers.</p>
<p>With the announcement of even cheaper Chromebooks and sticks,<br>we realize the value in providing secure messaging with friends<br>and families to this ever expanding market more than ever.</p>
<p>As such, we‚Äôd like to announce the Tox for Chrome OS technical<br>preview. You‚Äôll be one of the very first testers to this so<br>tons of bugs and issues are to be expected. While these clients<br>work, we do not encourage you to use them as your daily drivers.<br>You may experience data loss or other bugs that could prevent<br>you from using it correctly in some cases because of how early<br>this preview is.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While PC usage is on the decline, mobile usage has skyrocketed</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>and will continue to skyrocket in the future. We‚Äôve come to realize<br>that because of this we need to start working to support mobile<br>and mobile device users as best we can.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://blog.tox.im/2015/04/01/introducing-toxcoin/" target="_blank" rel="external">ToxCOIN</a> support having been recently<br>announced we realized progress was being made in the right direction,<br>but it wasn‚Äôt enough. We realized that some people might still<br>want to use traditional Tox IDs and use mobile devices at the<br>same time so we decided to take a step back from what we‚Äôre used<br>to and look at what much of our mobile using audience is already doing.</p>
<p>We saw typical mobile users send short video clips, talk in groups,<br>message automatically without setup, but nothing would work for Tox.<br>That was, until we noticed someone send a cute little heart icon to<br>her friend to express a complex feeling.</p>
<p>We realized that if one little character could express a whole emotion,<br>a couple of them could express a Tox ID, and so emoji support was born.</p>
<p>Starting today, most of our clients now support fun and friendly emoji<br>in place of existing scary and frightening Tox IDs, be it uTox or Toxy<br>with more clients in the works.</p>
<p>Ready to try it out? lean back, open uTox Android, and punch in<br><code>üåîüí°‚≠©‚¨É‚öøüöß‚üõ‚ãè‚©Æüöçüõ±üíñüñ≠‚öè‚ãªüòá‚àÅ‚§î‚Ñê‚ãú‚Ü∑‚öë‚çïüë´‚âß‚Ñáüòá</code> to join our always<br>popular groupchat in style.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new cryptocurrency to solve the issues tox has.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The main issues Tox face are that since we do not have central servers things<br>like making multiple devices have the same ‚Äúaccount‚Äù and offline messaging is<br>very difficult. For this reason we have searched long and hard for a real<br>decentralized solution to these problems. We are proud to announce today that<br>we have found such a solution. This solution also has far reaching applications<br>and could also for example enable the creation of more efficient crypto<br>currencies and solve world hunger.</p>
<p>So how does it work? First we define proof of trust as the amount of trust that<br>can be proven a node has in a distributed peer to peer network. The trust a<br>node has in the system is defined as the inverse of the non trust a node has in<br>the system. Trusted nodes are assumed to always behave correctly meaning<br>untrusted nodes will not behave correctly. By making each node look for nodes<br>that do not behave correctly non trusted nodes can therefore be identified and<br>disposed of by the network. This leaves a network that only contains trusted<br>nodes. Once a network is certain to contain only trusted nodes any system which<br>requires such a system can easily be implemented on top meaning it is possible<br>to implement every centralized system in an efficient decentralized manner.</p>
<p>Creating a decentralized internet will therefore be possible. The possibilities<br>are endless. With this revolutionary new technology anybody will be capable of<br>having their own website.</p>
<p>Why name this technology toxcoin? The best way to get this technology up and<br>running fast and to fund development is to make it its own crypto currency.<br>Toxcoin will also be used to fund development of Tox. Tox developers will be<br>payed in Toxcoins which will increase in value as more and more people used<br>Tox. If we assume a total market cap of 1 million toxcoin and assume each tox<br>user is worth 10$. When Tox reaches 1 billion users each toxcoin will be worth<br>10000$. Toxcoins are clearly an investment that will only grow in value.<br>Investing in this con will truly increase your money.</p>
<p>Is this an altcoin? No, toxcoin will be implemented using the bitcoin<br>blockchain as a base.</p>
<p>There is already some proof of concept code in the github repo but it is still<br>in very early stages.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Howdy folks, I feel like it‚Äôs a good time to get you all up to speed with Tox development.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="GSoC">GSoC</h2>
<p>For the 2nd year in a row, <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/tox" target="_blank" rel="external">Tox got accepted in to GSoC</a>. This is great news and will both help new students learn about and start contributing to open source, and help Tox developers improve our projects and advance our goals of making security mainstream.</p>
<p>Want to contribute to Tox in GSoC but you‚Äôre not a C/C++ developer? Tox has plenty of projects like ToxMe improvements in Python, Tox for Windows in C#, iOS and Android clients in Java/Objective C that you might enjoy. You can checkout our full list of ideas <a href="http://wiki.tox.im/GSoC/2015/Ideas" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ready to jump in and contribute to Tox? The deadline to write and submit a proposal for GSoC ends in a week but we encourage you to run it by us in <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23tox-gsoc-students" target="_blank" rel="external">#tox-gsoc-students</a> for review so we can help you improve it.</p>
<h2 id="Translations">Translations</h2>
<p>Want to contribute to Tox and speak another language? Localization and being able to ensure Tox is accessible to as many people as possible is something we pride in, but not something we can do alone. Localization in Tox and our sites depends on our community and bilingual Toxers like you taking the time to submit and review translations, and is something we greatly appreciate.</p>
<p>If you want to spend a few minutes becoming a translator or reviewer for our new site signup <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tox-website-next" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>, if you want we can also let you know of other things needing translations too.</p>
<h2 id="Toxcore">Toxcore</h2>
<p>The new API for toxcore mentioned in our last post is almost complete and almost ready to be merged, if you work on a client/wrapper/tool over Tox we encourage you to start porting your applications now. The new API is <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/new_api/toxcore/tox.h" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></p>
<h2 id="Git_mirror">Git mirror</h2>
<p>We now maintain a Git mirror of popular Tox repositories for archive reasons, located at <a href="https://git.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">git.tox.im</a>. The mirror is powered by our fork of <a href="http://gogs.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Gogs</a> and can be used as a personal code host if you‚Äôd like. Being a personal/non Github host isn‚Äôt our main goal, but we don‚Äôt prohibit it and a couple users/contributors have started using it as such.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-23T20:57:39.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone. We realize it‚Äôs been a while since the last post, but a lot has happened and Tox continues to progress, so there‚Äôs a lot to talk about.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="Tox_core">Tox core</h2>
<h4 id="Core">Core</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore" target="_blank" rel="external">toxcore</a> has been largely in maintenance mode, with memory leaks, logic errors and other bugs being fixed every day. Recently work has begun on implementing a <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tree/new_api" target="_blank" rel="external">new, cleaner API</a> written by the <a href="https://github.com/sonOfRa/tox4j" target="_blank" rel="external">Tox4j</a> developers.</p>
<h4 id="Bootstrap_daemon">Bootstrap daemon</h4>
<p>As a small treat, the <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tree/master/other/bootstrap_daemon" target="_blank" rel="external">boostrap daemon</a> now has systemd support, thanks to contributor <a href="https://github.com/ray65536" target="_blank" rel="external">ray65536</a>. It is also available as the package <code>tox-bootstrapd</code> from our Linux repositories.</p>
<h4 id="New_groupchats">New groupchats</h4>
<p>Additionally, work is progressing on the complete <a href="https://github.com/JFreegman/toxcore" target="_blank" rel="external">groupchat re-design</a> and overhaul, started by <a href="https://github.com/alnf" target="_blank" rel="external">alnf</a> and currently being led primarily by <a href="https://github.com/JFreegman" target="_blank" rel="external">JFreegman</a>. Features include moderation abilities and group chat persistence (!). These group chats are a long way from being ready to merge into master; however, there is now a properly <a href="https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/toxic_linux_beta/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/toxic" target="_blank" rel="external">modified build of Toxic</a> for Linux available with the changes.</p>
<p>You can also download the modified Toxic by installing <code>toxic-beta</code> from our Apt and Yum repos and running <code>toxic-beta</code>. Keep in mind that this copy is totally isolated from your existing Toxic install to prevent issues.</p>
<p>Please be aware that this is experimental testing code that will not work with the regular Tox network until we‚Äôve finished it and merged it with master. You can follow development on the #tox-groupchats IRC channel on Freenode.</p>
<h1 id="Audio_filtering_and_echo_cancellation">Audio filtering and echo cancellation</h1>
<p>It‚Äôs been around for a few months now, but <a href="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox" target="_blank" rel="external">uTox</a> has had audio filtering, provided by <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/filter_audio" target="_blank" rel="external">code</a> from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebRTC</a>. <a href="https://github.com/tux3/qTox" target="_blank" rel="external">qTox</a> now supports it as well.</p>
<h4 id="Experimental_echo_cancellation">Experimental echo cancellation</h4>
<p>Recently though, <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo" target="_blank" rel="external">irungentoo</a> (project founder and lead developer, in case you needed reminding :) ) has created <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/openal-soft-tox" target="_blank" rel="external">some patches for OpenAL</a> that allow for cancelling speaker echoes from your microphone‚Äôs sound input, a necessary feature for using a microphone without headphones or earbuds. uTox quickly put that to use, and qTox gained the same ability yesterday. Note that, if you compile these clients yourself, you will need to link against the patched version of OpenAL to enjoy echo cancellation. The official builds of both qTox and uTox are both built that way, and if you need to you can try using the <a href="https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/search/?q=openal" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenAL builds</a> on <a href="https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jenkins</a> used for qTox and uTox.</p>
<p>Currently echo cancellation is considered experimental, and Tox is seeking testing and feedback from users (on IRC or <a href="https://reddit.com/r/projecttox" target="_blank" rel="external">reddit</a>, for example) about how effective it is. If testing demonstrates that it is working properly, the patches will be submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenAL upstream</a> for merging.</p>
<h2 id="qTox_progress">qTox progress</h2>
<p>Besides continual minor improvements, qTox has gained the following major features.</p>
<h4 id="New_chatform">New chatform</h4>
<p>Over the last several months, <a href="https://github.com/krepa098" target="_blank" rel="external">krepa098</a> had been working on a complete rewrite of qTox‚Äôs chat form, and we‚Äôre happy to say that it was finally merged into master in the last week (over 4000 new lines of code!). Users should see significant reductions in memory and CPU usage (though some problems still exist), as well as being much prettier and easier to use. Copy and pasting in particular had been a big issue that should be pretty much solved, and there are some nice little animations (such as the typing notification).</p>
<h4 id="Local_file_encryption">Local file encryption</h4>
<p>Additionally, a fair bit of work (no where near as much as the new chat form required) was put into fixing the local file encryption and its interface in qTox, and that work was merged roughly two weeks ago. Users can now password protect their profile to safely transfer their profile to other computers, or even public computers. (Be sure to delete your profile when you leave a public computer!)</p>
<h4 id="Compact_contact_list">Compact contact list</h4>
<p>Finally, a lot of people probably love (or perhaps are unaware of) the new <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tmX8z9s.png" target="_blank" rel="external">compact contact list</a> option that qTox has, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lumirayz" target="_blank" rel="external">lumirayz</a>.</p>
<h4 id="OS_X">OS X</h4>
<p>A note for Mac OS X users: We pushed a number of major changes that totally reworked how the app works. Because of this, many improvements like Qt 5.3 -&gt; 5.4 mean updating it normally will break. Please be aware that this update includes a new icon that you may not be used to, and has many visual improvements.</p>
<p>In order to update cleanly you‚Äôll need to re-download qTox and drag the app in to your applications folder like usual. Your profiles won‚Äôt be harmed or modified in any way.</p>
<h2 id="uTox_progress">uTox progress</h2>
<p>uTox has been slowly receiving incremental improvements, primarily in the interface. For more details, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master" target="_blank" rel="external">commit log</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/irungentoo" target="_blank" rel="external">irungentoo‚Äôs Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Google_Summer_of_Code">Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>Like last year, Tox is applying to be a participating organization in the Google Summer of Code. Check back soon for updates.</p>
<h2 id="Android">Android</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, work continues on Tox4j, the replacement Java wrapper for core, and when that‚Äôs complete a new Android client will be developed from scratch on top of it. Another vague possibility is that qTox can be ported to Android, since it‚Äôs written in Qt 5; <a href="https://github.com/tux3" target="_blank" rel="external">tux3</a> (qTox‚Äôs primary author) has recently started the very basic framework of such a port, but it is currently significantly less useful than the old Antox.</p>
<p>A fork of the old Antox is currently being maintained against the Tox4j work in progress. You can download it by joining the Google Play beta or adding our F-Droid repo. Details on this are <a href="https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Website_improvements">Website improvements</h2>
<p>We‚Äôve been continuously working to improve and refine the experience for new users by making things simpler and more straightforward. With this, we‚Äôre currently working on a new site for tox.im and a new downloads page until the site is complete.</p>
<p>You can check out progress on the new site <a href="https://beta.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> and check out the progress on the new temporary downloads page <a href="https://download.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ToxMe_improvements">ToxMe improvements</h3>
<p>By popular demand we‚Äôve added a reverse lookup API to ToxMe. This allows people to look up DNS Discovery names using just a Tox ID as long as the ID they want to lookup isn‚Äôt marked private. It is documented <a href="https://github.com/Tox/toxme.se/blob/master/api.md" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Repository_improvements">Repository improvements</h2>
<p>If you use our RPM repo you may have suffered some issues downloading Tox due to an old revoked PGP key getting stuck in the signing process. We‚Äôve gone ahead and fixed all the issues associated with that and ensured that it works perfectly.</p>
<p>Supporting our new downloads page, we‚Äôve gone ahead and made the qTox packages automatically configure and setup the repo on your system by just installing the deb. This means for normal users all you‚Äôll have to do is click download and Ubuntu software center will pop up to automatically set everything up and ensure you always have the latest and greatest copy of qTox. If you had the repo installed before it may cause conflicts in apt. Please remove it by running <code>rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/toxrepo.list</code> and it‚Äôll take care of itself automatically.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, Tox follows a pretty fun rolling release style alpha development cycle where a lot of code changes and improves very rapidly without any set pace.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Because of the oh so fast pace of this we spent a good deal of time designing a cross-OS compilation system that churns out the latest copy of Tox no more than 5 minutes after a commit was pushed ready to be tested by you, our lovely users.</p>
<p>Because we churned out builds so fast we knew we needed a way to make sure you always ran the latest version of Tox + your favourite client so you could enjoy all the new features and bug fixes as soon as is possible. As such we statically linked and packaged the Linux clients sitting in a repo we run, designed autoupdaters for our Windows clients, and spent a good deal working on efficient ways to update on OS X seamlessly.</p>
<p>While this system works out wonderfully for those users who pull the tox clients from this repo or use our autoupdaters, there still exists the group of users who use distribution created packages. The problem with distro packaging is that for rolling release software it reduces and slows our ability to get the latest features or security fixes directly in to your hands.</p>
<p>Our issue with distro packaging at this stage is simple, we don‚Äôt want our users to miss out on features or critical security fixes at the hand of slower packagers or the bureaucratic cycle/freeze model that some Linux distributions implement(looking at you, Debian).</p>
<p>Why is this post happening now of all times? Lemmie tell you a little story.</p>
<p>A few days back a user entered our IRC channel asking for help joining group chats, he explained that he just ran apt-get update/upgrade and installed the latest Tox package and he wasn‚Äôt getting invites to the chat at all. After a bit of questioning I realised he used an obscure Ubuntu fork aimed at older systems that shipped a copy of utox that was almost a month old. It turns out he was attempting to join the new audio group chats with a super old client. After he added our up to date and current repositories he had no more issues.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt think this mess is still an issue, <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/compare/master%40%7B30day%7D...master" target="_blank" rel="external">I encourage you to take a look at all the changes that have happened to toxcore alone.</a></p>
<p>About versioning, it won‚Äôt happen while we‚Äôre in our rolling release alpha build cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Toxing, Sean</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Howdy folks for the 2nd time today!</p>
<p>Remember that time you got Linux running on your Wii? When you managed to install Debian to your Raspberry Pi?</p>
<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be <em>super cool</em> if you could Tox your friends without dealing with a compiler or git?<br><a id="more"></a><br>Thankfully we agree, and we know you have tons of other cases where x86/x86_64 might not be the architecture of your PC. We believe you should be able to Tox no matter where you are or what you use without a bunch of work or hacks, so we‚Äôre introducing the Tox Everywhere initiative.</p>
<p>Be it your PowerPC Mac running Linux or your Wii, the Tox Everywhere initiative was created to give everyone with whatever odd case you may have the same ease of ability to use Tox as our traditional x86 friends</p>
<p>In the coming weeks expect to see more posts on more architectures and clients, all ready to go directly in our repo so you can install Tox with the same repo instructions we already have on our <a href="https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries" title="binaries" target="_blank" rel="external">binaries</a> page.</p>
<p>Phase one of this program is targeting the Arm, Armv7, PowerPC, and PowerPC64 architectures and is currently being created as we speak. <a href="http://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/qTox-Linux-pkg/" title="PowerPC packages for qTox" target="_blank" rel="external">PowerPC packages for qTox</a> already exist ready for you to install, though they are not yet in the repo.</p>
<p>For the 2nd time, happy Toxing</p>
<p>ps: If you have any questions on what we‚Äôll support or when shoot me an email or Tox me, sean [at] tox [.] im</p>
