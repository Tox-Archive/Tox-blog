    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, Tox follows a pretty fun rolling release style alpha development cycle where a lot of code changes and improves very rapidly without any set pace.</p>
<p>Because of the oh so fast pace of this we spent a good deal of time designing a cross-OS compilation system that churns out the latest copy of Tox no more than 5 minutes after a commit was pushed ready to be tested by you, our lovely users.</p>
<p>Because we churned out builds so fast we knew we needed a way to make sure you always ran the latest version of Tox + your favourite client so you could enjoy all the new features and bug fixes as soon as is possible. As such we statically linked and packaged the Linux clients sitting in a repo we run, designed autoupdaters for our Windows clients, and spent a good deal working on efficient ways to update on OS X seamlessly.</p>
<p>While this system works out wonderfully for those users who pull the tox clients from this repo or use our autoupdaters, there still exists the group of users who use distribution created packages. The problem with distro packaging is that for rolling release software it reduces and slows our ability to get the latest features or security fixes directly in to your hands.</p>
<p>Our issue with distro packaging at this stage is simple, we don’t want our users to miss out on features or critical security fixes at the hand of slower packagers or the bureaucratic cycle/freeze model that some Linux distributions implement(looking at you, Debian).</p>
<p>Why is this post happening now of all times? Lemmie tell you a little story.</p>
<p>A few days back a user entered our IRC channel asking for help joining group chats, he explained that he just ran apt-get update/upgrade and installed the latest Tox package and he wasn’t getting invites to the chat at all. After a bit of questioning I realised he used an obscure Ubuntu fork aimed at older systems that shipped a copy of utox that was almost a month old. It turns out he was attempting to join the new audio group chats with a super old client. After he added our up to date and current repositories he had no more issues.</p>
<p>If you don’t think this mess is still an issue, <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/compare/master%40%7B30day%7D...master" target="_blank" rel="external">I encourage you to take a look at all the changes that have happened to toxcore alone.</a></p>
<p>About versioning, it won’t happen while we’re in our rolling release alpha build cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Toxing, Sean</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Howdy folks for the 2nd time today!</p>
<p>Remember that time you got Linux running on your Wii? When you managed to install Debian to your Raspberry Pi?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be _super cool _if you could Tox your friends without dealing with a compiler or git?</p>
<p>Thankfully we agree, and we know you have tons of other cases where x86/x86_64 might not be the architecture of your PC. We believe you should be able to Tox no matter where you are or what you use without a bunch of work or hacks, so we’re introducing the Tox Everywhere initiative.</p>
<p>Be it your PowerPC Mac running Linux or your Wii, the Tox Everywhere initiative was created to give everyone with whatever odd case you may have the same ease of ability to use Tox as our traditional x86 friends</p>
<p>In the coming weeks expect to see more posts on more architectures and clients, all ready to go directly in our repo so you can install Tox with the same repo instructions we already have on our <a href="https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries" title="binaries" target="_blank" rel="external">binaries</a> page.</p>
<p>Phase one of this program is targeting the Arm, Armv7, PowerPC, and PowerPC64 architectures and is currently being created as we speak. <a href="http://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/qTox-Linux-pkg/" title="PowerPC packages for qTox" target="_blank" rel="external">PowerPC packages for qTox</a> already exist ready for you to install, though they are not yet in the repo.</p>
<p>For the 2nd time, happy Toxing</p>
<p>ps: If you have any questions on what we’ll support or when shoot me an email or Tox me, sean [at] tox [.] im</p>

<p>Another day another release. This release is probably the biggest in the recent past and there’s some screenshots to go along with it.</p>
<p>The Login activity has been changed to be given a nice background. Also, instead of having to write the name of your profile, the text box has been swapped for a dropdown list of all the profiles you have created to make logging in a much simpler and quicker process.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1b07ad60-468a-11e4-839c-b52f035218d9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Create Account activity has also been changed to be given a nice looking background. The weird lookingÂ  checkbox from before has been turned into an incognito button.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/9697a970-4550-11e4-8227-c0dddf6bcae1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last design change to take place was to the friend requests. You can now accept and reject them right from the contacts list so you don’t have to bring in the new pane or long hold on them.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/qyietr.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-design wise, there have been various crash fixes. The app will also wake the CPU when doing network activity to try and keep you online over extended periods of time, and most importantly, you can now send any file in a file transfer, not just attach an image. Lastly, changing the app’s language will no longer require a restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: A couple more things that I forgot I implemented since the last release. The app now comes with Wi-Fi only enabled by default and you can turn this off in the settings if you want to use your mobile connection as well as Wi-Fi. Also, the app comes with TCP only by default which uses less battery and less data (about 50-100mb a day) at the expense of slower file transfers and slightly slower times for friend requests to go through. To speed things up, you can enabled UDP in the settings.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What’s new: Save file location changed, bug fixes, bug fixes, new translations and some small features like the icon on windows changing colour when a message is received.</p>
<p>For credits and a detailed list of all changes: <a href="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master" title="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master</a></p>
<p>The main change in this update and why I made this post is that uTox now saves to roaming appdata instead of local appdata which should lead to less people losing their saves. uTox should automatically load the save from its previous location meaning you don’t have to move it there yourself. What you should do that uTox doesn’t do is remove the old location.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone isn’t aware of this yet, I will be the one maintaining uTox from now on until notsecure is less busy.</p>
<p>Expect something bigger next week.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">There seems to be a problem of crashing when registering (both skipping and not skipping). I’d recommend not upgrading just yet and I’ll try and get it fixed by the end of the week. Sorry for the wait</span></p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve written a blog post for a release of Antox but I felt with the major changes in this version, it would be best if I did.</p>
<p>The major change in this release which may cause confusion is the introduction of an account system. When you create an account, it assigns the account a new tox id as well as its own friends list and chat logs, so that you can easily create and manage multiple identities from the same application. You just logout of one account, and login to another to swap tox id’s. No hassle in dragging tox save files about. It also takes the account name and registers it on <a href="https://toxme.se" target="_blank" rel="external">https://toxme.se</a> so that others can add you using just the account name. If you don’t want to be signed up on toxme, you should tick “skip registration” in the registration screen. I’ve taken these steps to try and make the application extremely easy to use. Regular users are used to creating accounts and having people add that account name and this is what I’m trying to emulate for tox. Hopefully others like the changes I’ve made and that other clients follow so that the experience is the same across all platforms.</p>
<p>Some other notable changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicer looking tabs in the main section</li>
<li>You can now accept and reject file transfers</li>
<li>File transfer speed is now displayed</li>
<li>Better ordering and searching of the contacts list</li>
<li>The Tox ID can now be found under the ‘Advanced’ tab of Settings<br>We will soon have A/V in antox as well. The functions have already been wrapped in jToxCore and are just being proof-read as we speak to make sure it’s correct. Once merged and ready, audio is the first function I want to get into antox.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit: </strong>If you tick “skip registration” an account name is still required so that multiple tox id’s can be used. It uses the account name you entered as the file name for the tox save so that when you login, it loads the appropriate tox id</p>
