    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone. We realize it’s been a while since the last post, but a lot has happened and Tox continues to progress, so there’s a lot to talk about.</p>
<h2 id="Tox_core">Tox core</h2>
<h4 id="core">core</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore" target="_blank" rel="external">toxcore</a> has been largely in maintenance mode, with memory leaks, logic errors and other bugs being fixed every day. Recently work has begun on implementing a <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tree/new_api" target="_blank" rel="external">new, cleaner API</a> written by the <a href="https://github.com/sonOfRa/tox4j" target="_blank" rel="external">Tox4j</a> developers.</p>
<h4 id="Bootstrap_daemon">Bootstrap daemon</h4>
<p>As a small treat, the <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tree/master/other/bootstrap_daemon" target="_blank" rel="external">boostrap daemon</a> now has systemd support, thanks to contributor <a href="https://github.com/ray65536" target="_blank" rel="external">ray65536</a>. It is also available as the package <code>tox-bootstrapd</code> from our Linux repositories.</p>
<h4 id="New_groupchats">New groupchats</h4>
<p>Additionally, work is progressing on the complete <a href="https://github.com/JFreegman/toxcore" target="_blank" rel="external">groupchat re-design</a> and overhaul, started by <a href="https://github.com/alnf" target="_blank" rel="external">alnf</a> and currently being led primarily by <a href="https://github.com/JFreegman" target="_blank" rel="external">JFreegman</a>. Features include moderation abilities and group chat persistence (!). These group chats are a long way from being ready to merge into master; however, there is now a properly <a href="https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/toxic_linux_beta/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/toxic" target="_blank" rel="external">modified build of Toxic</a> for Linux available with the changes.</p>
<p>You can also download the modified Toxic by installing <code>toxic-beta</code> from our Apt and Yum repos and running <code>toxic-beta</code>. Keep in mind that this copy is totally isolated from your existing Toxic install to prevent issues.</p>
<p>Please be aware that this is experimental testing code that will not work with the regular Tox network until we’ve finished it and merged it with master. You can follow development on the #tox-groupchats IRC channel on Freenode.</p>
<h1 id="Audio_filtering_and_echo_cancellation">Audio filtering and echo cancellation</h1>
<p>It’s been around for a few months now, but <a href="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox" target="_blank" rel="external">uTox</a> has had audio filtering, provided by <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/filter_audio" target="_blank" rel="external">code</a> from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/" target="_blank" rel="external">WebRTC</a>. <a href="https://github.com/tux3/qTox" target="_blank" rel="external">qTox</a> now supports it as well.</p>
<h4 id="Experimental_echo_cancellation">Experimental echo cancellation</h4>
<p>Recently though, <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo" target="_blank" rel="external">irungentoo</a> (project founder and lead developer, in case you needed reminding :) ) has created <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/openal-soft-tox" target="_blank" rel="external">some patches for OpenAL</a> that allow for cancelling speaker echoes from your microphone’s sound input, a necessary feature for using a microphone without headphones or earbuds. uTox quickly put that to use, and qTox gained the same ability yesterday. Note that, if you compile these clients yourself, you will need to link against the patched version of OpenAL to enjoy echo cancellation. The official builds of both qTox and uTox are both built that way, and if you need to you can try using the <a href="https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/search/?q=openal" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenAL builds</a> on <a href="https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jenkins</a> used for qTox and uTox.</p>
<p>Currently echo cancellation is considered experimental, and Tox is seeking testing and feedback from users (on IRC or <a href="https://reddit.com/r/projecttox" target="_blank" rel="external">reddit</a>, for example) about how effective it is. If testing demonstrates that it is working properly, the patches will be submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenAL upstream</a> for merging.</p>
<h2 id="qTox_progress">qTox progress</h2>
<p>Besides continual minor improvements, qTox has gained the following major features.</p>
<h4 id="New_chatform">New chatform</h4>
<p>Over the last several months, <a href="https://github.com/krepa098" target="_blank" rel="external">krepa098</a> had been working on a complete rewrite of qTox’s chat form, and we’re happy to say that it was finally merged into master in the last week (over 4000 new lines of code!). Users should see significant reductions in memory and CPU usage (though some problems still exist), as well as being much prettier and easier to use. Copy and pasting in particular had been a big issue that should be pretty much solved, and there are some nice little animations (such as the typing notification).</p>
<h4 id="Local_file_encryption">Local file encryption</h4>
<p>Additionally, a fair bit of work (no where near as much as the new chat form required) was put into fixing the local file encryption and its interface in qTox, and that work was merged roughly two weeks ago. Users can now password protect their profile to safely transfer their profile to other computers, or even public computers. (Be sure to delete your profile when you leave a public computer!)</p>
<h4 id="Compact_contact_list">Compact contact list</h4>
<p>Finally, a lot of people probably love (or perhaps are unaware of) the new <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tmX8z9s.png" target="_blank" rel="external">compact contact list</a> option that qTox has, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lumirayz" target="_blank" rel="external">lumirayz</a>.</p>
<h4 id="OS_X">OS X</h4>
<p>A note for Mac OS X users: We pushed a number of major changes that totally reworked how the app works. Because of this, many improvements like Qt 5.3 -&gt; 5.4 mean updating it normally will break. Please be aware that this update includes a new icon that you may not be used to, and has many visual improvements.</p>
<p>In order to update cleanly you’ll need to re-download qTox and drag the app in to your applications folder like usual. Your profiles won’t be harmed or modified in any way.</p>
<h2 id="uTox_progress">uTox progress</h2>
<p>uTox has been slowly receiving incremental improvements, primarily in the interface. For more details, you can check out the <a href="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master" target="_blank" rel="external">commit log</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/irungentoo" target="_blank" rel="external">irungentoo’s Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Google_Summer_of_Code">Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>Like last year, Tox is applying to be a participating organization in the Google Summer of Code. Check back soon for updates.</p>
<h2 id="Android">Android</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, work continues on Tox4j, the replacement Java wrapper for core, and when that’s complete a new Android client will be developed from scratch on top of it. Another vague possibility is that qTox can be ported to Android, since it’s written in Qt 5; <a href="https://github.com/tux3" target="_blank" rel="external">tux3</a> (qTox’s primary author) has recently started the very basic framework of such a port, but it is currently significantly less useful than the old Antox.</p>
<p>A fork of the old Antox is currently being maintained against the Tox4j work in progress. You can download it by joining the Google Play beta or adding our F-Droid repo. Details on this are <a href="https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Website_improvements">Website improvements</h2>
<p>We’ve been continuously working to improve and refine the experience for new users by making things simpler and more straightforward. With this, we’re currently working on a new site for tox.im and a new downloads page until the site is complete.</p>
<p>You can check out progress on the new site <a href="https://beta.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> and check out the progress on the new temporary downloads page <a href="https://downloads.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ToxMe_improvements">ToxMe improvements</h3>
<p>By popular demand we’ve added a reverse lookup API to ToxMe. This allows people to look up DNS Discovery names using just a Tox ID as long as the ID they want to lookup isn’t marked private. It is documented <a href="https://github.com/Tox/toxme.se/blob/master/api.md" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Repository_improvements">Repository improvements</h2>
<p>If you use our RPM repo you may have suffered some issues downloading Tox due to an old revoked PGP key getting stuck in the signing process. We’ve gone ahead and fixed all the issues associated with that and ensured that it works perfectly.</p>
<p>Supporting our new downloads page, we’ve gone ahead and made the qTox packages automatically configure and setup the repo on your system by just installing the deb. This means for normal users all you’ll have to do is click download and Ubuntu software center will pop up to automatically set everything up and ensure you always have the latest and greatest copy of qTox. If you had the repo installed before it may cause conflicts in apt. Please remove it by running <code>rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/toxrepo.list</code> and it’ll take care of itself automatically.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As many of you know, Tox follows a pretty fun rolling release style alpha development cycle where a lot of code changes and improves very rapidly without any set pace.<br><a id="more"></a><br>Because of the oh so fast pace of this we spent a good deal of time designing a cross-OS compilation system that churns out the latest copy of Tox no more than 5 minutes after a commit was pushed ready to be tested by you, our lovely users.</p>
<p>Because we churned out builds so fast we knew we needed a way to make sure you always ran the latest version of Tox + your favourite client so you could enjoy all the new features and bug fixes as soon as is possible. As such we statically linked and packaged the Linux clients sitting in a repo we run, designed autoupdaters for our Windows clients, and spent a good deal working on efficient ways to update on OS X seamlessly.</p>
<p>While this system works out wonderfully for those users who pull the tox clients from this repo or use our autoupdaters, there still exists the group of users who use distribution created packages. The problem with distro packaging is that for rolling release software it reduces and slows our ability to get the latest features or security fixes directly in to your hands.</p>
<p>Our issue with distro packaging at this stage is simple, we don’t want our users to miss out on features or critical security fixes at the hand of slower packagers or the bureaucratic cycle/freeze model that some Linux distributions implement(looking at you, Debian).</p>
<p>Why is this post happening now of all times? Lemmie tell you a little story.</p>
<p>A few days back a user entered our IRC channel asking for help joining group chats, he explained that he just ran apt-get update/upgrade and installed the latest Tox package and he wasn’t getting invites to the chat at all. After a bit of questioning I realised he used an obscure Ubuntu fork aimed at older systems that shipped a copy of utox that was almost a month old. It turns out he was attempting to join the new audio group chats with a super old client. After he added our up to date and current repositories he had no more issues.</p>
<p>If you don’t think this mess is still an issue, <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/compare/master%40%7B30day%7D...master" target="_blank" rel="external">I encourage you to take a look at all the changes that have happened to toxcore alone.</a></p>
<p>About versioning, it won’t happen while we’re in our rolling release alpha build cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Toxing, Sean</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Howdy folks for the 2nd time today!</p>
<p>Remember that time you got Linux running on your Wii? When you managed to install Debian to your Raspberry Pi?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be <em>super cool</em> if you could Tox your friends without dealing with a compiler or git?<br><a id="more"></a><br>Thankfully we agree, and we know you have tons of other cases where x86/x86_64 might not be the architecture of your PC. We believe you should be able to Tox no matter where you are or what you use without a bunch of work or hacks, so we’re introducing the Tox Everywhere initiative.</p>
<p>Be it your PowerPC Mac running Linux or your Wii, the Tox Everywhere initiative was created to give everyone with whatever odd case you may have the same ease of ability to use Tox as our traditional x86 friends</p>
<p>In the coming weeks expect to see more posts on more architectures and clients, all ready to go directly in our repo so you can install Tox with the same repo instructions we already have on our <a href="https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries" title="binaries" target="_blank" rel="external">binaries</a> page.</p>
<p>Phase one of this program is targeting the Arm, Armv7, PowerPC, and PowerPC64 architectures and is currently being created as we speak. <a href="http://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/qTox-Linux-pkg/" title="PowerPC packages for qTox" target="_blank" rel="external">PowerPC packages for qTox</a> already exist ready for you to install, though they are not yet in the repo.</p>
<p>For the 2nd time, happy Toxing</p>
<p>ps: If you have any questions on what we’ll support or when shoot me an email or Tox me, sean [at] tox [.] im</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Major changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to set an avatar. You can set it in the config file (see the <a href="https://github.com/Tox/toxic/blob/master/misc/toxic.conf.example" target="_blank" rel="external">example config file</a>) or with the command ‘/avatar &lt;path&gt;’ (Note: This command will only set it temporarily until you restart your client).</li>
<li>Previous chat history is now loaded when you open a chat window.</li>
<li>Chat log files are now renamed when a contact changes their name instead of creating a new log file and leaving the old one.</li>
<li>Resolved a performance issue where idle CPU usage was unacceptably high when compiled with sound notifications.</li>
<li>Some small UI changes that need no explanation.</li>
<li>Lots of important bug fixes<br>The currently ongoing toxcore groupchat rewrite broke Toxic’s implementation of groupchats. Any version of Toxic older than <strong>c56c6cc2</strong> will behave very strangely with the new groupchats (this may be temporary).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, as of writing this GroupBot is up to date with the latest core, so if you can’t get an invite from him then you need to update your toxcore.</p>
<p>tldr; update everything</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another day another release. This release is probably the biggest in the recent past and there’s some screenshots to go along with it.</p>
<p>The Login activity has been changed to be given a nice background. Also, instead of having to write the name of your profile, the text box has been swapped for a dropdown list of all the profiles you have created to make logging in a much simpler and quicker process.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<img src="/images/antox-0-13-0-1.png">


<p>The Create Account activity has also been changed to be given a nice looking background. The weird looking checkbox from before has been turned into an incognito button.</p>
<img src="/images/antox-0-13-0-2.png">


<p>The last design change to take place was to the friend requests. You can now accept and reject them right from the contacts list so you don’t have to bring in the new pane or long hold on them.</p>
<img src="/images/antox-0-13-0-3.png">


<p>Non-design wise, there have been various crash fixes. The app will also wake the CPU when doing network activity to try and keep you online over extended periods of time, and most importantly, you can now send any file in a file transfer, not just attach an image. Lastly, changing the app’s language will no longer require a restart.</p>
<p>Edit: A couple more things that I forgot I implemented since the last release. The app now comes with Wi-Fi only enabled by default and you can turn this off in the settings if you want to use your mobile connection as well as Wi-Fi. Also, the app comes with TCP only by default which uses less battery and less data (about 50-100mb a day) at the expense of slower file transfers and slightly slower times for friend requests to go through. To speed things up, you can enabled UDP in the settings.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What’s new: Save file location changed, bug fixes, bug fixes, new translations and some small features like the icon on Windows changing colour when a message is received.</p>
<p>For credits and a detailed list of all changes: <a href="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master" title="https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master</a></p>
<p>The main change in this update and why I made this post is that uTox now saves to roaming appdata instead of local appdata which should lead to less people losing their saves. uTox should automatically load the save from its previous location meaning you don’t have to move it there yourself. What you should do that uTox doesn’t do is remove the old location.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone isn’t aware of this yet, I will be the one maintaining uTox from now on until notsecure is less busy.</p>
<p>Expect something bigger next week.</p>
