Part of our dedication to the success of Tox is keeping people aware of changes; it's also apart of our goal to be as transparent as possible. Being transparent, however, usually means users have to sift through numerous commits a day trying to figure out what changed, and what didn't. This blog aims to bridge the gap between timely updates, and mucking through various Git-related websites. Here, we'll explain changes made in the Tox Core and its clients, in a way not just for developers, but so that even the average Joe will understand.
