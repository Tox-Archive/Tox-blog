Packets are now generally smaller in size and the protocol used to transport the data securely has been redesigned in order to prevent possible evil relays from interfering with the connections between you and your friends. The protocol also now supports padding which can be used to obscure the size of the data transmitted.</p><p>Tox can switch between relayed TCP and direct UDP connections seamlessly meaning if you initially connect to a friend with a TCP relay and then for some reason 5 minutes later the hole punching works and the direct UDP starts working Tox will automatically switch from one to the other without the users noticing anything.</p><p>This also means that Tox can switch between different relays if one used to connect to the other peer goes offline. Again, without the users noticing anything.</p><p>There have also been some fixes and optimizations to increase the initial connection speed meaning you should see your friends come online faster than before.</p><p>I will warn you though that group chats and A/V have not yet been updated to work with the TCP so issues with them right now are perfectly normal.</p><p>If you try Tox but can’t connect to anyone make sure you are using an updated core and bootstrapping into the network with an updated node, (<a href="https://wiki.tox.im/Nodes" target="_blank" rel="external">https://wiki.tox.im/Nodes</a>)</p><p>In other news Google Summer of Code has officially started which means the amount of work done on Tox will increase.</p><p>This update brings us closer to our goal of creating the best skype replacement that works everywhere while being both secure and simple to use.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><div class="entry-meta-footer"><span class="category"><div class="article-category"><a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/Tox-Core/">Tox Core</a></div></span> <span class="tags"></span></div></footer></article><hr class="article-devider"><article id="post-tcp-branch-merged-with-master" class="post"><footer class="entry-meta-header"><span class="meta-elements date"><a href="/2014/05/18/tcp-branch-merged-with-master/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2014-05-19T00:00:16.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 18 2014</time></a></span> <span class="meta-elements author">Tox Foundation</span><div class="commentscount"></div></footer><header class="entry-header"><h1 itemprop="name" class="entry-title"><a class="article-title" href="/2014/05/18/tcp-branch-merged-with-master/">TCP Branch Merged with Master</a></h1></header><div class="entry-content"><p>irungentoo has merged the TCP branch he has been long working on today, which now enabled those behind restrictive NATs access to TCP relays in order to connect with other users.

If every message had a different nonce this puzzle would be unsolvable.</p><p>I’ll start by explaining how crypto_box in NaCl works before telling you the solution.</p><p>crypto_box_keypair(pk,sk) generates a Curve25519 public/private keypair for us. crypto_box_beforenm(k,pk,sk) then uses our secret key and the other guys public key to generate a key using ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman)</p><p>The other guy also uses it on his side and gets the same key as us.</p><p>So both now have the same 256bit key that only they know.</p><p>what do they do with that key? they use it to encrypt/decrypt data using xsalsa20: a stream cipher.</p><p>How does a stream cipher work?</p><p>You have a function to generate a stream of pseudorandom bytes based on a nonce and a key: crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k)</p><p>To encrypt a message, just generate a stream as long as the message then XOR the message with the stream.</p><p>Since the stream looks random, the stream xored with the message will also appear to be random.</p><p>To decrypt the message, just use the same nonce and key to generate a stream then xor the stream with the encrypted message to get the message.</p><p>Now, this is nice and all but how do we protect ourselves against someone modifying the message? Or someone trying to send us fake messages?</p><p>That’s where the MAC (message authentication code) Poly1305 comes in.</p><p>MACs are used to authenticate messages, by verifying them, the receiver</p><p>crypto_onetimeauth(a,m,mlen,k) Is used to generate a 16 byte authenticator that is appended to the beginning of each plaintext message encrypted with crypto_box right before being actually encrypted.</p><p>Poly1305 requires that the key given to it is always different so it takes the first 32bytes that comes out of crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) (clen is always 32 + 16 (the length of the MAC) + msglen) for that key.</p><p>So, it generates an xsalsa20 stream 48 bytes longer than the message, takes the first 32 to generate the 16 byte MAC, appends it to the beginning of the message and encrypts the MAC+Message with the rest of the generated stream bytes.</p><p>So how do we solve the puzzle?</p><p>nonces are reused which means the stream generated by crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) is the same for all messages.</p><p>The first two packets are obviously the handshake (size checks out).</p><p>This particular python wrapper puts the 24 byte nonce at the beginning of each encrypted message and we know the handshake.</p><p>So we just xor the plaintext handshake with where the message is in the encrypted message to get the stream.</p><p>With the stream we can then decrypt all the packets that use that same nonce by xoring the stream with the encrypted message.</p><p>Repeat that for the packets with the other nonce and we can decrypt everything.</p><p>Easy right?</p><p>This is why every single message must be encrypted with a different nonce, so that a different stream is used for each message.</p><p>Further reading:<br><a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html</a><br><a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/stream.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://nacl.cr.yp.to/stream.html</a><br><a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/onetimeauth.html" target="_blank" rel="external">http://nacl.cr.yp.to/onetimeauth.html</a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519</a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman</a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305-AES" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305-AES</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce</a></p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><div class="entry-meta-footer"><span class="category"><div class="article-category"><a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/Tox-Core/">Tox Core</a></div></span> <span class="tags"></span></div></footer></article><hr class="article-devider"><article id="post-stf-4-14" class="post"><footer class="entry-meta-header"><span class="meta-elements date"><a href="/2014/04/27/stf-4-14/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2014-04-27T06:05:15.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">Apr 27 2014</time></a></span> <span class="meta-elements author">Tox Foundation</span><div class="commentscount"></div></footer><header class="entry-header"><h1 itemprop="name" class="entry-title"><a class="article-title" href="/2014/04/27/stf-4-14/">The State of the Foundation address, April 2014</a></h1></header><div class="entry-content"><p>I’d like to take a moment to keep you folks informed about the status of the foundation behind Tox, something I plan on doing monthly.</p><p>Late December of 2013 Project Tox officially became a ULX Foundation project, this granted Tox developers the ability to attend shows like CES at no charge and participate in Google Summer of Code, all while providing legal a presence for the project.</p><p>For the past two months Tox developers and ULX Foundation folks discussed a rename, ideas were bounced everywhere but nothing was settled on. To deal with this rename an acting board was formed.</p><p>Half way through April the idea to write a technical paper came up, the acting board agreed to form the Tox Technical Reporting working group, who are still working on this.</p><p>On the 24th a decision on the rename was made, the acting board unanimously agreed to adopt the name Tox Foundation. On this same day the acting board agreed to change the title Tox Developer to Tox Engineer, designating between those who do engineering related tasks and those who do other essential tasks.</p><p>On the 25th the paperwork was filed, and the rename was official.</p><p>Next up is adopting a new set of bylaws, adopting a new board, and working out all the financial aspects of everything. We hope that with the Foundation by our sides, the Tox Project and all of our future projects will prosper.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><div class="entry-meta-footer"><span class="category"><div class="article-category"><a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/Tox-Foundation/">Tox Foundation</a></div></span> <span class="tags"></span></div></footer></article><hr class="article-devider"><article id="post-downtime" class="post"><footer class="entry-meta-header"><span class="meta-elements date"><a href="/2014/04/13/downtime/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2014-04-13T09:25:48.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">Apr 13 2014</time></a></span> <span class="meta-elements author">Tox Foundation</span><div class="commentscount"></div></footer><header class="entry-header"><h1 itemprop="name" class="entry-title"><a class="article-title" href="/2014/04/13/downtime/">Downtime, DNS, and a reliance on others</a></h1></header><div class="entry-content"><p>At around 4 pm PST tox.im and its subdomains failed to load, along with libtoxcore.so.</p><p>About 6 hours later it returned, after my late notice and quick action.</p><p>After a quick investigation I determined that the web server was up and the nameservers were up, all working at 100%. Further investigation determined that the nameservers that powered the domain the nameservers were at went down, and after quickly moving that domains nameservers and a bit of DNS propagation service was restored.</p><p>So, what exactly went wrong? Tox’s DNS is provided by service X, behind nameservers on domain b. Domain b once used service X, though for DNSSEC support moved to service Y. Service Y was chosen because DNSSEC DNS providers are rather rare, and these servers provided faster response times. Service Y’s 4 nameservers were all taken down as a result of what we suspect was a DDoS attack, rendering queries on the nameservers for Tox useless. DNS glue was designed to prevent this issue, stop that catch-22, done by providing nameserver names and IPs in the whois record itself. This managed to get ignored by every DNS resolver, resulting in no queries going through. I was able to address this issue by fetching the bind file from X for domain b and deploying nameservers with service Z. After a bit of mitigation everything was all fine, with availability all around.</p><p>Service Y was chosen due to price and limited selection, though this later turned out to be a poor decision, service Z is a larger well known provider of Internet services, who offer a SLA, DDoS protection, and amazing uptime; at about 12 times the price.</p><p>At the end of the day, this was a painful lesson to learn. DNS isn’t something to be taken lightly, and is something we really do need to pay a pretty penny for.</p><p>Why don’t we run our own DNS servers? DNS is something that demands a level of maintainability, when something goes wrong fixing the server is difficult due to not being able to resolve the servers domain. This means more downtime, harder to maintain, and generally more expensive to run, and more messes like what happened yesterday.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><div class="entry-meta-footer"><span class="category"><div class="article-category"><a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/Uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></div></span> <span class="tags"></span></div></footer></article><hr class="article-devider"><article id="post-sts-approaches-v0-0-5" class="post"><footer class="entry-meta-header"><span class="meta-elements date"><a href="/2014/04/10/sts-approaches-v0-0-5/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2014-04-10T16:22:05.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">Apr 10 2014</time></a></span> <span class="meta-elements author">Tox Foundation</span><div class="commentscount"></div></footer><header class="entry-header"><h1 itemprop="name" class="entry-title"><a class="article-title" href="/2014/04/10/sts-approaches-v0-0-5/">STS Approaches v0.0.5</a></h1></header><div class="entry-content"><p>After a little more than week of work, the STS is rapidly approaching a first draft.

C is the worst language to develop a lightweight skype replacement in. Compared to modern languages like C#, javascript and java, C is an old and deprecated language only used by old men with long beards who refuse to update their old MSDOS machines to the much better and modern windows 8.1. In order to become a popular application, Tox must be built with modern tools and not languages like C that belong in a museum.</p><p>We have decided to rewrite Tox in javascript, this will enable us to make use of advanced web frameworks and base our application on advanced libraries such as WinJS and Node.js in order to create the best user experience possible.</p><p>We have listened to those who say we have been re inventing the wheel and pledge to never do it again. As such we will only use proven libraries for the functionality Tox needs.</p><p>Tox will now use i2p for the peer finding, this will also enable you to connect anonymously to other peers. For the networking we will use the very popular C++ Boost libraries to boost our application to a next level of performance and portability. Instead of NaCl (a relatively unknown crypto library) Tox will use OpenSSL, the standard library for secure communication on the internet. Instead of stupidly using the audio and video encoders and decoders directly, Tox will now use WebRTC for audio and video communications. Because of this, Tox will now be compatible with web browsers. Instead of the relatively new and untested ECC cryptography, Tox will now use good old RSA and AES for encryption. We will now use 512 bit RSA keys that are much stronger than the weak 256 bit ECC keys Tox uses right now. Tox will now use namecoin so that everyone can have a unique username which will increase ease of use by large amounts and solve one of the biggest issues that people have been having with current Tox.</p><p>A huge issue that current Tox has is that it fails to sync conversations across devices, we will solve this by using facebook. Using facebook we can securely store the contents of all conversations and your contacts in a location that can be accessed using an extremely secure https connection from anywhere. This will also prevent murderers, terrorists, racists, pedophiles, privacy activists and other people that could hurt the image of Tox from using it for extended periods of time.</p><p>In order to enhance the user interface, the official Tox clients will include buttons so that users can share the contents of their conversations on free social networking websites such as reddit and twitter.</p><p>A significant amount of resources will be spent to create a Tox client that works entirely in the cloud. Tox will now be usable by anyone with a web browser and a facebook account. We now truly see that the browser is the future and that applications running natively on the desktop will soon disappear completely. We had previously though web clients could not be secure but realized that we were wrong. Encrypting things browser side with javascript served from a central web server is much more safe than using unsafe languages like C.</p><p>To finance our operations, some advertisements will be added to every Tox client, the only way to disable them will be to compile Tox manually from source which will be very hard to do because we plan to soon remove the bloated build systems from every client.</p><p>I must also warn you that we will not be using git or github to develop this new version of Tox. Git is a creation of Linus Torvalds, a very backwards man who thinks that object oriented programming is very bad and who hates modern safe languages like C++ and java. Since we don’t agree with him, we cannot in good faith use anything he is the CEO of. Therefore and also to promote synergy between our many developers, we have also decided to migrate our version control system to CVS. CVS has the advantage of forcing people to talk more about their pull request, thus streamlining our communications.
