    	<p>We realized after many people complained that the way we currently use to develop Tox is wrong. C is the worst language to develop a lightweight skype replacement in. Compared to modern languages like C#, JavaScript and Java, C is an old and deprecated language only used by old men with long beards who refuse to update their old MSDOS machines to the much better and modern Windows 8.1. In order to become a popular application, Tox must be built with modern tools and not languages like C that belong in a museum.</p>
<p>We have decided to rewrite Tox in JavaScript, this will enable us to make use of advanced web frameworks and base our application on advanced libraries such as WinJS and Node.js in order to create the best user experience possible.</p>
<p>We have listened to those who say we have been re inventing the wheel and pledge to never do it again. As such we will only use proven libraries for the functionality Tox needs.</p>
<p>Tox will now use i2p for the peer finding, this will also enable you to connect anonymously to other peers. For the networking we will use the very popular C++ Boost libraries to boost our application to a next level of performance and portability. Instead of NaCl (a relatively unknown crypto library) Tox will use OpenSSL, the standard library for secure communication on the internet. Instead of stupidly using the audio and video encoders and decoders directly, Tox will now use WebRTC for audio and video communications. Because of this, Tox will now be compatible with web browsers. Instead of the relatively new and untested ECC cryptography, Tox will now use good old RSA and AES for encryption. We will now use 512 bit RSA keys that are much stronger than the weak 256 bit ECC keys Tox uses right now. Tox will now use namecoin so that everyone can have a unique username which will increase ease of use by large amounts and solve one of the biggest issues that people have been having with current Tox.</p>
<p>A huge issue that current Tox has is that it fails to sync conversations across devices, we will solve this by using facebook. Using facebook we can securely store the contents of all conversations and your contacts in a location that can be accessed using an extremely secure https connection from anywhere. This will also prevent murderers, terrorists, racists, pedophiles, privacy activists and other people that could hurt the image of Tox from using it for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the user interface, the official Tox clients will include buttons so that users can share the contents of their conversations on free social networking websites such as reddit and twitter.</p>
<p>A significant amount of resources will be spent to create a Tox client that works entirely in the cloud. Tox will now be usable by anyone with a web browser and a facebook account. We now truly see that the browser is the future and that applications running natively on the desktop will soon disappear completely. We had previously though web clients could not be secure but realized that we were wrong. Encrypting things browser side with JavaScript served from a central web server is much more safe than using unsafe languages like C.</p>
<p>To finance our operations, some advertisements will be added to every Tox client, the only way to disable them will be to compile Tox manually from source which will be very hard to do because we plan to soon remove the bloated build systems from every client.</p>
<p>I must also warn you that we will not be using git or github to develop this new version of Tox. Git is a creation of Linus Torvalds, a very backwards man who thinks that object oriented programming is very bad and who hates modern safe languages like C++ and Java. Since we don’t agree with him, we cannot in good faith use anything he is the CEO of. Therefore and also to promote synergy between our many developers, we have also decided to migrate our version control system to CVS. CVS has the advantage of forcing people to talk more about their pull request, thus streamlining our communications. We are sure this paradigm shift will help us push the envelope on Tox development.</p>
<p>We understand that this is a huge change for Tox however we believe this is for the best.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued support,</p>
<p>Project Tox.</p>

    </h1>
  

	</header>
	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>As Tox grows and more clients are created, we feel it is time to create a Tox standard. Doing so will enable us to promote a single, cohesive brand despite the numerous clients. STS aims to offer a handbook for existing and potential client developers to follow so they can all remain consistent, yet unique in their own way. Terminology such as the <strong>Tox ID</strong> will represent the 76-character string used to identify users, but <strong>Nickname </strong>and <strong>Names</strong> being used to personally recognize friends. This will prevent confusion for users who wish to switch clients, and allow Tox to focus on pushing a single brand. At the moment, we are <strong>strongly recommending</strong> adherence to the STS, as it will foster a more productive environment, but we recognize that it’s the right of the developer to chose. Once the STS has been completed and v1.0.0 has been published, we will no longer offer support or publicity to clients that wish to deviate from the STS. We regret that we must take such a stance, but it is required that we take such measures in order to uphold one of Tox’s foremost goals: to provide a smooth and easy experience for all walks of life.</p>
<p>Like everything Tox does, the Single Tox Standard is on GitHub where you may open tickets to address concerns, questions, or offer feedback. Your continued support of Tox is appreciated as we draft the first version of STS.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>A lot of work is being done on Toxicity recently, one of which is <a href="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/128/jenkins-ci-and-signed-commits" target="_blank" rel="external">signed commits</a>! There was a small hiccup in getting used to it, but from now on everything should be nice and trustable. There’s also a lot of under-the-hood refactoring happening, cleaning up messy code and such, better for developers.</p>
<p>The reason for this post, though, is the addition of background running and notifications. Currently Toxicity is using a max 10 minute timer (by iOS) to allow apps to utilize background threads while the app isn’t running in the foreground. This allows the app to not completely shutdown and restart Tox core every time you switch out of the app! Right now tox_do has a bit of a bigger interval in-between, but users should still be warned about battery drainage.</p>
<p>As a result of this background servicing, notifications were possible to add, using simple UILocalNotifications, for incoming messages. It shows the sender, and which groupchat it came from provided it wasn’t a friend’s message. There’s a bit of work to be done still. This mainly includes switching to appropriate chat windows once the user opens the app via notification.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>We’ve finally arrived at a new version of Antox after a period of slow development. With this release comes two new major features, as well as a myriad of small bug fixes and slight changes not worth mentioning.</p>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Your friends now have profiles, just long hold on them to access it. The profiles contain all your friend’s information including a QR image of their Tox key for easier sharing amongst your social group.</li>
<li><p>You can now give your friends nicknames/aliases to easier identify your friend. This can be set when adding them for the first time, and later updated in their profile. Clearing their alias altogether will return to displaying their Tox nickname.<br><strong>Upcoming Features in the Next Release</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing indicators to show when your friends are writing to you. You’ll also send a typing status to your friends. These indicators will be a setting so you can turn them off should you wish to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>Manually set your language. Currently you will be shown translated strings automatically if they exist based upon your locale, however to give you more control a setting will also be added to let you change the language.</li>
<li>Welcome Tour to show off all the Antox features and gently introduce new users to Tox itself.</li>
<li>Continued effort like always to fix the disconnects and any crashes.<br>You can get the updated APKs as always from <a href="http://download.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></li>

    </h1>
  

	</header>
	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>As we’ve hit the deadline for student applications, I thought I’d take a moment to share the outcome.</p>
<p>For 2014, Google accepted 190 organizations, with 4420 students sending in 6313 proposals. This means that on average a random organization received around 33 proposals, if divided evenly. This means that on average, each org would receive around 0.5% of all proposals.</p>
<p>Now, the number of proposals being divided equally does not happen, some organizations might be more known, some might have few areas to do proposals, others might be umbrellas.</p>
<p>Project Tox received 88 proposals, meaning over 1.39% of all proposals were sent to us. As Project Tox is a bit of an umbrella, students applied to one of 6 major categories; being Core, AV, Qt, Venom, iOS, and Android. Stats on where proposals went have yet to be calculated, though a good majority went to Android and Qt.</p>
<p>This rush of students was surprisingly successful, for our first GSoC, I can’t wait to see what good comes out of the chosen students, and what comes out of future summers.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>Recently pushed was the api-fix branch by irungentoo. Nothing too big was changed, fortunately, but things were changed to keep consistencies and so forth. Included in this merge was:</p>
<ul>
<li>No more forcing NULL terminated strings in Tox Core (meaning whatever you send to the core, it won’t chop off the end forcefully)</li>
<li>Some naming changes like tox_get_friend_id -&gt; tox_get_friend_number to clear some confusions</li>
<li>Many <code>int</code>s were changed to <code>int32_t</code> for consistency and clarity<br>You can check all the changes <a href="https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core/commit/5770a0e29ab35efb1ef656ab81c499635fc5fecf" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>, as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the clients have been able to update their builds to reflect the API changes as well, amazingly fast. There might be even more changes to come to make the API even better in the future! In other news, more work is being done on TCP in the core. Can’t wait for that to finish.</p>

    	<p>The main Toxicity dev has finally finished with some personal stuff and is back to working on Toxicity, rather than merging a bunch of pull requests! Along with that the Jenkins build for Toxicity is working perfectly, thanks to stqism (Sean) and stal for their work on that.</p>
<p>Along with some recent commits, a few big issues were resolved, including updating core and fixing some PR bugs. Hopefully there’ll be more in the future. A little bird hinted to me something about background threading…</p>

    	<p>This is the first post in our new Jenkins section. In this section, we will post updates about how we’re building Tox automatically.</p>
<p>Today we started rolling out a new feature in our builds, Signed git commits. What are signed commits, and why are we using them? Well, the first question is answered quite easily: We use PGP signatures in order to verify the integrity of any commit. If you don’t know what PGP is, you can read about it here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" title="Pretty Good Privacy" target="_blank" rel="external">PGP</a>. Now, why are we doing this? This answer is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>A friend (we’ll call him Bob) of mine recently told me a little story about how something went horribly wrong when using git. In git, you can set your <code>user.email</code> and <code>user.name</code> to arbitrary values. There is no way to check if the email and name you gave are actually YOURS.</p>
<p>Now, there was another user who had push access to the repository, and they were malicious, as later discovered. Let’s call them Mallory. One day, Mallory decided to push a malicious feature to the git repository. Mallory was smart however, and so they did this before creating the commit: <code>git config user.name Bob</code> and <code>git config user.email bob@example.com</code>.</p>
<p>You might already see where this is going now. Mallory pushed the malicious code under the name and email of Bob. When the “feature” was discovered, Bob was blamed immediately, and noone even thought about blaming Mallory (who didn’t work at the company anymore at this point) because after all, the email and name stated quite clearly that Bob committed that code. Gladly, Bob wasn’t fired, as he could assure that it was NOT him who committed the code.</p>
<p>Now, what can we do to prevent this from happening? It’s surprisingly easy. Git has always offered the functionality to sign Tags with PGP, but starting with version 1.7.9, functionality to sign commits was added. It’s very easy to enable, too. First step, locate your PGP key:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ gpg --list-secret-keys | grep ^sec</div><div class="line">sec <span class="number">2048</span>R/<span class="number">75</span>D697BF <span class="number">2013</span>-<span class="number">07</span>-<span class="number">08</span> [expires: <span class="number">2023</span>-<span class="number">07</span>-<span class="number">06</span>]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Second step, set up that key to be used with git:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ git config --global user.signingkey <span class="number">75</span>D697BF</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And now you’re ready to sign your git commits with <code>git commit -S</code>. Now that commit is signed, and everyone that has your PGP public key can confirm that YOU made this commit (or someone stole your private key, but that’s a completely different problem, and you should revoke your key immediately.) You can verify the signatures on commits like this: <code>git log --show-signature</code>. Since the output is very long, I put the output for different scenarios in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/sonOfRa/9649586" title="Git commit signatures" target="_blank" rel="external">gist</a></p>
<p>Does that mean that every Tox contributor has to set up PGP now? While personally, I think EVERYONE should have PGP, no. You can go on developing and adding Pull Request just as you did before. Only the repository maintainers of core, the bindings, and the clients need to worry about this.</p>
<p>And what does all this have to do with our Build Server? Currently, our Build Server fetches the latest changes from our different repositories and makes the updated code available to the build jobs, which then create a new binary each time the build is triggered by a change. This results in downloads that are minutes older than the latest commit, at the most.</p>
<p>Even though malicious commits are very unlikely, a malicious commit would also trigger a build on all clients, and until it is reverted, we would have built malicious binaries. In order to prevent this, we check the signatures of the commits each time the code is checked out. If the verification fails, the checkout will be marked as failed, and no builds using the unsigned commit would be made.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the repository maintainers? Not much, except that they have to set up PGP and start signing their commits. There is one small problem, though. It is not possible to sign Pull Request through the Github Web-Interface. Therefore, we have to check out the Pull Request locally. Github has a guide how to do this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally" title="Local PR" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. Now, after you’ve checked out the Pull Request you want to merge, and it’s in the branch “1234”, this is how you would merge the PR and push the result to master:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ git checkout master</div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># --no-ff creates a merge commit</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># -S signs the commit</span></div><div class="line">$ git merge --no-ff -S <span class="number">1234</span></div><div class="line">$ git push origin master</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>--no-ff</code> option is vital, because we need a commit on master for which we can check the signature. If the option is ommitted, the commits might simply be added into the master branch, and signing will be problematic.</p>
<p>Here’s some handy aliases so you don’t forget to sign your commits or merges, and one to view signed commits when using git log:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment"># View log with signatures with 'git slog'</span></div><div class="line">$ git config --global alias.slog <span class="string">"log --show-signature"</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># Create a signed commit with 'git scommit'</span></div><div class="line">$ git config --global alias.scommit <span class="string">"commit -S"</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># Create a signed, non-fast-forward merge</span></div><div class="line">$ git config --global alias.smerge <span class="string">"merge -S --no-ff"</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
