	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>Yesterday, I made this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/irungentoo/58a8b5da5b2becd09e0f" target="_blank" rel="external">https://gist.github.com/irungentoo/58a8b5da5b2becd09e0f</a></p>
<p>If this is the first time you see this puzzle and want to try solving it then stop reading this now.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed that only one anonymous person seemed to know how to solve it so I’m writing this to educate you on how the crypto Tox uses to encrypt messages works.</p>
<p>First of all, the flaw in the secure_chat.py program in the puzzle is that nonces are reused for every message. If every message had a different nonce this puzzle would be unsolvable.</p>
<p>I’ll start by explaining how crypto_box in NaCl works before telling you the solution.</p>
<p>crypto_box_keypair(pk,sk) generates a Curve25519 public/private keypair for us. crypto_box_beforenm(k,pk,sk) then uses our secret key and the other guys public key to generate a key using ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman)</p>
<p>The other guy also uses it on his side and gets the same key as us.</p>
<p>So both now have the same 256bit key that only they know.</p>
<p>what do they do with that key? they use it to encrypt/decrypt data using xsalsa20: a stream cipher.</p>
<p>How does a stream cipher work?</p>
<p>You have a function to generate a stream of pseudorandom bytes based on a nonce and a key: crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k)</p>
<p>To encrypt a message, just generate a stream as long as the message then XOR the message with the stream.</p>
<p>Since the stream looks random, the stream xored with the message will also appear to be random.</p>
<p>To decrypt the message, just use the same nonce and key to generate a stream then xor the stream with the encrypted message to get the message.</p>
<p>Now, this is nice and all but how do we protect ourselves against someone modifying the message? Or someone trying to send us fake messages?</p>
<p>That’s where the MAC (message authentication code) Poly1305 comes in.</p>
<p>MACs are used to authenticate messages, by verifying them, the receiver</p>
<p>crypto_onetimeauth(a,m,mlen,k) Is used to generate a 16 byte authenticator that is appended to the beginning of each plaintext message encrypted with crypto_box right before being actually encrypted.</p>
<p>Poly1305 requires that the key given to it is always different so it takes the first 32bytes that comes out of crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) (clen is always 32 + 16 (the length of the MAC) + msglen) for that key.</p>
<p>So, it generates an xsalsa20 stream 48 bytes longer than the message, takes the first 32 to generate the 16 byte MAC, appends it to the beginning of the message and encrypts the MAC+Message with the rest of the generated stream bytes.</p>
<p>So how do we solve the puzzle?</p>
<p>nonces are reused which means the stream generated by crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) is the same for all messages.</p>
<p>The first two packets are obviously the handshake (size checks out).</p>
<p>This particular python wrapper puts the 24 byte nonce at the beginning of each encrypted message and we know the handshake.</p>
<p>So we just xor the plaintext handshake with where the message is in the encrypted message to get the stream.</p>
<p>With the stream we can then decrypt all the packets that use that same nonce by xoring the stream with the encrypted message.</p>
<p>Repeat that for the packets with the other nonce and we can decrypt everything.</p>
<p>Easy right?</p>
<p>This is why every single message must be encrypted with a different nonce, so that a different stream is used for each message.</p>

    	<p>I’d like to take a moment to keep you folks informed about the status of the foundation behind Tox, something I plan on doing monthly.</p>
<p>Late December of 2013 Project Tox officially became a ULX Foundation project, this granted Tox developers the ability to attend shows like CES at no charge and participate in Google Summer of Code, all while providing legal a presence for the project.</p>
<p>For the past two months Tox developers and ULX Foundation folks discussed a rename, ideas were bounced everywhere but nothing was settled on. To deal with this rename an acting board was formed.</p>
<p>Half way through April the idea to write a technical paper came up, the acting board agreed to form the Tox Technical Reporting working group, who are still working on this.</p>
<p>On the 24th a decision on the rename was made, the acting board unanimously agreed to adopt the name Tox Foundation. On this same day the acting board agreed to change the title Tox Developer to Tox Engineer, designating between those who do engineering related tasks and those who do other essential tasks.</p>
<p>On the 25th the paperwork was filed, and the rename was official.</p>
<p>Next up is adopting a new set of bylaws, adopting a new board, and working out all the financial aspects of everything. We hope that with the Foundation by our sides, the Tox Project and all of our future projects will prosper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>At around 4 pm PST tox.im and its subdomains failed to load, along with libtoxcore.so.</p>
<p>About 6 hours later it returned, after my late notice and quick action.</p>
<p>After a quick investigation I determined that the web server was up and the nameservers were up, all working at 100%. Further investigation determined that the nameservers that powered the domain the nameservers were at went down, and after quickly moving that domains nameservers and a bit of DNS propagation service was restored.</p>
<p>So, what exactly went wrong? Tox’s DNS is provided by service X, behind nameservers on domain b. Domain b once used service X, though for DNSSEC support moved to service Y. Service Y was chosen because DNSSEC DNS providers are rather rare, and these servers provided faster response times. Service Y’s 4 nameservers were all taken down as a result of what we suspect was a DDoS attack, rendering queries on the nameservers for Tox useless. DNS glue was designed to prevent this issue, stop that catch-22, done by providing nameserver names and IPs in the whois record itself. This managed to get ignored by every DNS resolver, resulting in no queries going through. I was able to address this issue by fetching the bind file from X for domain b and deploying nameservers with service Z. After a bit of mitigation everything was all fine, with availability all around.</p>
<p>Service Y was chosen due to price and limited selection, though this later turned out to be a poor decision, service Z  is a larger well known provider of Internet services, who offer a SLA, DDoS protection, and amazing uptime; at about 12 times the price.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this was a painful lesson to learn. DNS isn’t something to be taken lightly, and is something we really do need to pay a pretty penny for.</p>
<p>Why don’t we run our own DNS servers? DNS is something that demands a level of maintainability, when something goes wrong fixing the server is difficult due to not being able to resolve the servers domain. This means more downtime, harder to maintain, and generally more expensive to run, and more messes like what happened yesterday.</p>

    	<p>After a little more than week of work, the STS is rapidly approaching a first draft. Standards such as DNS Discovery and the URI standard have been set, and naming schemes of often used protocols such as the Tox Network have been established. We’re always looking for criticism, so all input is welcome—even grammar corrections.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>A new version of Antox has been released with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter the friends list by groups e.g. Online, Offline.</li>
<li>You can now block friends so that you no longer receive messages or friend requests from them. As well as this, neither of you will see each other come online.</li>
<li>Friends can now be added using the Tox DNS Discovery Version 1 and Version 2. For more information, see the <a href="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/182/introducing-sts-single-tox-standard" target="_blank" rel="external">STS</a>. This is a very technical feature at the moment but in the feature it will mean you can add each other with usernames once some more things have been ironed out.</li>
<li>You can manually set your language in the settings window should the default language picked for you by Android not suffice.</li>
<li>A Russian translation has been added to Antox.</li>
<li><p>Improved and more efficient backend to help reduce network connection issues<br><strong>Still to come in new releases</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing indicators and a welcome tour (I promised these in the last blog post)</p>
</li>
<li>Ability to create custom groups which you can then assign friends to<br><strong>Antox is now on F-Droid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the last release, you can now get Antox on F-Droid by adding <a href="http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo" target="_blank" rel="external">http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo</a> to your repo list. To do this, go to ‘Manage Repos’ in F-Droid. These will only be updated with every major release (or when a bug is fixed) rather than with every slight change.</p>
