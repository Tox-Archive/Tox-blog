	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>Yesterday, I made this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/irungentoo/58a8b5da5b2becd09e0f" target="_blank" rel="external">https://gist.github.com/irungentoo/58a8b5da5b2becd09e0f</a></p>
<p>If this is the first time you see this puzzle and want to try solving it then stop reading this now.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed that only one anonymous person seemed to know how to solve it so I’m writing this to educate you on how the crypto Tox uses to encrypt messages works.</p>
<p>First of all, the flaw in the secure_chat.py program in the puzzle is that nonces are reused for every message. If every message had a different nonce this puzzle would be unsolvable.</p>
<p>I’ll start by explaining how crypto_box in NaCl works before telling you the solution.</p>
<p>crypto_box_keypair(pk,sk) generates a Curve25519 public/private keypair for us. crypto_box_beforenm(k,pk,sk) then uses our secret key and the other guys public key to generate a key using ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman)</p>
<p>The other guy also uses it on his side and gets the same key as us.</p>
<p>So both now have the same 256bit key that only they know.</p>
<p>what do they do with that key? they use it to encrypt/decrypt data using xsalsa20: a stream cipher.</p>
<p>How does a stream cipher work?</p>
<p>You have a function to generate a stream of pseudorandom bytes based on a nonce and a key: crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k)</p>
<p>To encrypt a message, just generate a stream as long as the message then XOR the message with the stream.</p>
<p>Since the stream looks random, the stream xored with the message will also appear to be random.</p>
<p>To decrypt the message, just use the same nonce and key to generate a stream then xor the stream with the encrypted message to get the message.</p>
<p>Now, this is nice and all but how do we protect ourselves against someone modifying the message? Or someone trying to send us fake messages?</p>
<p>That’s where the MAC (message authentication code) Poly1305 comes in.</p>
<p>MACs are used to authenticate messages, by verifying them, the receiver</p>
<p>crypto_onetimeauth(a,m,mlen,k) Is used to generate a 16 byte authenticator that is appended to the beginning of each plaintext message encrypted with crypto_box right before being actually encrypted.</p>
<p>Poly1305 requires that the key given to it is always different so it takes the first 32bytes that comes out of crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) (clen is always 32 + 16 (the length of the MAC) + msglen) for that key.</p>
<p>So, it generates an xsalsa20 stream 48 bytes longer than the message, takes the first 32 to generate the 16 byte MAC, appends it to the beginning of the message and encrypts the MAC+Message with the rest of the generated stream bytes.</p>
<p>So how do we solve the puzzle?</p>
<p>nonces are reused which means the stream generated by crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) is the same for all messages.</p>
<p>The first two packets are obviously the handshake (size checks out).</p>
<p>This particular python wrapper puts the 24 byte nonce at the beginning of each encrypted message and we know the handshake.</p>
<p>So we just xor the plaintext handshake with where the message is in the encrypted message to get the stream.</p>
<p>With the stream we can then decrypt all the packets that use that same nonce by xoring the stream with the encrypted message.</p>
<p>Repeat that for the packets with the other nonce and we can decrypt everything.</p>
<p>Easy right?</p>
<p>This is why every single message must be encrypted with a different nonce, so that a different stream is used for each message.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>I’d like to take a moment to keep you folks informed about the status of the foundation behind Tox, something I plan on doing monthly.</p>
<p>Late December of 2013 Project Tox officially became a ULX Foundation project, this granted Tox developers the ability to attend shows like CES at no charge and participate in Google Summer of Code, all while providing legal a presence for the project.</p>
<p>For the past two months Tox developers and ULX Foundation folks discussed a rename, ideas were bounced everywhere but nothing was settled on. To deal with this rename an acting board was formed.</p>
<p>Half way through April the idea to write a technical paper came up, the acting board agreed to form the Tox Technical Reporting working group, who are still working on this.</p>
<p>On the 24th a decision on the rename was made, the acting board unanimously agreed to adopt the name Tox Foundation. On this same day the acting board agreed to change the title Tox Developer to Tox Engineer, designating between those who do engineering related tasks and those who do other essential tasks.</p>
<p>On the 25th the paperwork was filed, and the rename was official.</p>
<p>Next up is adopting a new set of bylaws, adopting a new board, and working out all the financial aspects of everything. We hope that with the Foundation by our sides, the Tox Project and all of our future projects will prosper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>At around 4 pm PST tox.im and its subdomains failed to load, along with libtoxcore.so.</p>
<p>About 6 hours later it returned, after my late notice and quick action.</p>
<p>After a quick investigation I determined that the web server was up and the nameservers were up, all working at 100%. Further investigation determined that the nameservers that powered the domain the nameservers were at went down, and after quickly moving that domains nameservers and a bit of DNS propagation service was restored.</p>
<p>So, what exactly went wrong? Tox’s DNS is provided by service X, behind nameservers on domain b. Domain b once used service X, though for DNSSEC support moved to service Y. Service Y was chosen because DNSSEC DNS providers are rather rare, and these servers provided faster response times. Service Y’s 4 nameservers were all taken down as a result of what we suspect was a DDoS attack, rendering queries on the nameservers for Tox useless. DNS glue was designed to prevent this issue, stop that catch-22, done by providing nameserver names and IPs in the whois record itself. This managed to get ignored by every DNS resolver, resulting in no queries going through. I was able to address this issue by fetching the bind file from X for domain b and deploying nameservers with service Z. After a bit of mitigation everything was all fine, with availability all around.</p>
<p>Service Y was chosen due to price and limited selection, though this later turned out to be a poor decision, service Z is a larger well known provider of Internet services, who offer a SLA, DDoS protection, and amazing uptime; at about 12 times the price.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this was a painful lesson to learn. DNS isn’t something to be taken lightly, and is something we really do need to pay a pretty penny for.</p>
<p>Why don’t we run our own DNS servers? DNS is something that demands a level of maintainability, when something goes wrong fixing the server is difficult due to not being able to resolve the servers domain. This means more downtime, harder to maintain, and generally more expensive to run, and more messes like what happened yesterday.</p>

    	<p>After a little more than week of work, the STS is rapidly approaching a first draft. Standards such as DNS Discovery and the URI standard have been set, and naming schemes of often used protocols such as the Tox Network have been established. We’re always looking for criticism, so all input is welcome—even grammar corrections.</p>

    	<p>A new version of Antox has been released with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter the friends list by groups e.g. Online, Offline.</li>
<li>You can now block friends so that you no longer receive messages or friend requests from them. As well as this, neither of you will see each other come online.</li>
<li>Friends can now be added using the Tox DNS Discovery Version 1 and Version 2. For more information, see the <a href="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/182/introducing-sts-single-tox-standard" target="_blank" rel="external">STS</a>. This is a very technical feature at the moment but in the feature it will mean you can add each other with usernames once some more things have been ironed out.</li>
<li>You can manually set your language in the settings window should the default language picked for you by Android not suffice.</li>
<li>A Russian translation has been added to Antox.</li>
<li><p>Improved and more efficient backend to help reduce network connection issues<br><strong>Still to come in new releases</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing indicators and a welcome tour (I promised these in the last blog post)</p>
</li>
<li>Ability to create custom groups which you can then assign friends to<br><strong>Antox is now on F-Droid</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the last release, you can now get Antox on F-Droid by adding <a href="http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo" target="_blank" rel="external">http://markwinter.me/fdroid/repo</a> to your repo list. To do this, go to ‘Manage Repos’ in F-Droid. These will only be updated with every major release (or when a bug is fixed) rather than with every slight change.</p>

    </h1>

    	<p>We realized after many people complained that the way we currently use to develop Tox is wrong. C is the worst language to develop a lightweight skype replacement in. Compared to modern languages like C#, JavaScript and Java, C is an old and deprecated language only used by old men with long beards who refuse to update their old MSDOS machines to the much better and modern Windows 8.1. In order to become a popular application, Tox must be built with modern tools and not languages like C that belong in a museum.</p>
<p>We have decided to rewrite Tox in JavaScript, this will enable us to make use of advanced web frameworks and base our application on advanced libraries such as WinJS and Node.js in order to create the best user experience possible.</p>
<p>We have listened to those who say we have been re inventing the wheel and pledge to never do it again. As such we will only use proven libraries for the functionality Tox needs.</p>
<p>Tox will now use i2p for the peer finding, this will also enable you to connect anonymously to other peers. For the networking we will use the very popular C++ Boost libraries to boost our application to a next level of performance and portability. Instead of NaCl (a relatively unknown crypto library) Tox will use OpenSSL, the standard library for secure communication on the internet. Instead of stupidly using the audio and video encoders and decoders directly, Tox will now use WebRTC for audio and video communications. Because of this, Tox will now be compatible with web browsers. Instead of the relatively new and untested ECC cryptography, Tox will now use good old RSA and AES for encryption. We will now use 512 bit RSA keys that are much stronger than the weak 256 bit ECC keys Tox uses right now. Tox will now use namecoin so that everyone can have a unique username which will increase ease of use by large amounts and solve one of the biggest issues that people have been having with current Tox.</p>
<p>A huge issue that current Tox has is that it fails to sync conversations across devices, we will solve this by using facebook. Using facebook we can securely store the contents of all conversations and your contacts in a location that can be accessed using an extremely secure https connection from anywhere. This will also prevent murderers, terrorists, racists, pedophiles, privacy activists and other people that could hurt the image of Tox from using it for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the user interface, the official Tox clients will include buttons so that users can share the contents of their conversations on free social networking websites such as reddit and twitter.</p>
<p>A significant amount of resources will be spent to create a Tox client that works entirely in the cloud. Tox will now be usable by anyone with a web browser and a facebook account. We now truly see that the browser is the future and that applications running natively on the desktop will soon disappear completely. We had previously though web clients could not be secure but realized that we were wrong. Encrypting things browser side with JavaScript served from a central web server is much more safe than using unsafe languages like C.</p>
<p>To finance our operations, some advertisements will be added to every Tox client, the only way to disable them will be to compile Tox manually from source which will be very hard to do because we plan to soon remove the bloated build systems from every client.</p>
<p>I must also warn you that we will not be using git or github to develop this new version of Tox. Git is a creation of Linus Torvalds, a very backwards man who thinks that object oriented programming is very bad and who hates modern safe languages like C++ and Java. Since we don’t agree with him, we cannot in good faith use anything he is the CEO of. Therefore and also to promote synergy between our many developers, we have also decided to migrate our version control system to CVS. CVS has the advantage of forcing people to talk more about their pull request, thus streamlining our communications. We are sure this paradigm shift will help us push the envelope on Tox development.</p>
<p>We understand that this is a huge change for Tox however we believe this is for the best.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued support,</p>
<p>Project Tox.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>As Tox grows and more clients are created, we feel it is time to create a Tox standard. Doing so will enable us to promote a single, cohesive brand despite the numerous clients. STS aims to offer a handbook for existing and potential client developers to follow so they can all remain consistent, yet unique in their own way. Terminology such as the <strong>Tox ID</strong> will represent the 76-character string used to identify users, but <strong>Nickname </strong>and <strong>Names</strong> being used to personally recognize friends. This will prevent confusion for users who wish to switch clients, and allow Tox to focus on pushing a single brand. At the moment, we are <strong>strongly recommending</strong> adherence to the STS, as it will foster a more productive environment, but we recognize that it’s the right of the developer to chose. Once the STS has been completed and v1.0.0 has been published, we will no longer offer support or publicity to clients that wish to deviate from the STS. We regret that we must take such a stance, but it is required that we take such measures in order to uphold one of Tox’s foremost goals: to provide a smooth and easy experience for all walks of life.</p>
<p>Like everything Tox does, the Single Tox Standard is on GitHub where you may open tickets to address concerns, questions, or offer feedback. Your continued support of Tox is appreciated as we draft the first version of STS.</p>

    	<p>A lot of work is being done on Toxicity recently, one of which is <a href="https://blog.libtoxcore.so/128/jenkins-ci-and-signed-commits" target="_blank" rel="external">signed commits</a>! There was a small hiccup in getting used to it, but from now on everything should be nice and trustable. There’s also a lot of under-the-hood refactoring happening, cleaning up messy code and such, better for developers.</p>
<p>The reason for this post, though, is the addition of background running and notifications. Currently Toxicity is using a max 10 minute timer (by iOS) to allow apps to utilize background threads while the app isn’t running in the foreground. This allows the app to not completely shutdown and restart Tox core every time you switch out of the app! Right now tox_do has a bit of a bigger interval in-between, but users should still be warned about battery drainage.</p>
<p>As a result of this background servicing, notifications were possible to add, using simple UILocalNotifications, for incoming messages. It shows the sender, and which groupchat it came from provided it wasn’t a friend’s message. There’s a bit of work to be done still. This mainly includes switching to appropriate chat windows once the user opens the app via notification.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>We’ve finally arrived at a new version of Antox after a period of slow development. With this release comes two new major features, as well as a myriad of small bug fixes and slight changes not worth mentioning.</p>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Your friends now have profiles, just long hold on them to access it. The profiles contain all your friend’s information including a QR image of their Tox key for easier sharing amongst your social group.</li>
<li><p>You can now give your friends nicknames/aliases to easier identify your friend. This can be set when adding them for the first time, and later updated in their profile. Clearing their alias altogether will return to displaying their Tox nickname.<br><strong>Upcoming Features in the Next Release</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Typing indicators to show when your friends are writing to you. You’ll also send a typing status to your friends. These indicators will be a setting so you can turn them off should you wish to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>Manually set your language. Currently you will be shown translated strings automatically if they exist based upon your locale, however to give you more control a setting will also be added to let you change the language.</li>
<li>Welcome Tour to show off all the Antox features and gently introduce new users to Tox itself.</li>
<li>Continued effort like always to fix the disconnects and any crashes.<br>You can get the updated APKs as always from <a href="http://download.tox.im" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></li>
</ol>

    </h1>

	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>As we’ve hit the deadline for student applications, I thought I’d take a moment to share the outcome.</p>
<p>For 2014, Google accepted 190 organizations, with 4420 students sending in 6313 proposals. This means that on average a random organization received around 33 proposals, if divided evenly. This means that on average, each org would receive around 0.5% of all proposals.</p>
<p>Now, the number of proposals being divided equally does not happen, some organizations might be more known, some might have few areas to do proposals, others might be umbrellas.</p>
<p>Project Tox received 88 proposals, meaning over 1.39% of all proposals were sent to us. As Project Tox is a bit of an umbrella, students applied to one of 6 major categories; being Core, AV, Qt, Venom, iOS, and Android. Stats on where proposals went have yet to be calculated, though a good majority went to Android and Qt.</p>
<p>This rush of students was surprisingly successful, for our first GSoC, I can’t wait to see what good comes out of the chosen students, and what comes out of future summers.</p>
