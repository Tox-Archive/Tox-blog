    	<p>The main Toxicity dev has finally finished with some personal stuff and is back to working on Toxicity, rather than merging a bunch of pull requests! Along with that the Jenkins build for Toxicity is working perfectly, thanks to stqism (Sean) and stal for their work on that.</p>
<p>Along with some recent commits, a few big issues were resolved, including updating core and fixing some PR bugs. Hopefully there’ll be more in the future. A little bird hinted to me something about background threading…</p>

    	<p>This is the first post in our new Jenkins section. In this section, we will post updates about how we’re building Tox automatically.</p>
<p>Today we started rolling out a new feature in our builds, Signed git commits. What are signed commits, and why are we using them? Well, the first question is answered quite easily: We use PGP signatures in order to verify the integrity of any commit. If you don’t know what PGP is, you can read about it here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy" title="Pretty Good Privacy" target="_blank" rel="external">PGP</a>. Now, why are we doing this? This answer is a little more complicated.</p>
<p>A friend (we’ll call him Bob) of mine recently told me a little story about how something went horribly wrong when using git. In git, you can set your <code>user.email</code> and <code>user.name</code> to arbitrary values. There is no way to check if the email and name you gave are actually YOURS.</p>
<p>Now, there was another user who had push access to the repository, and they were malicious, as later discovered. Let’s call them Mallory. One day, Mallory decided to push a malicious feature to the git repository. Mallory was smart however, and so they did this before creating the commit: <code>git config user.name Bob</code> and <code>git config user.email bob@example.com</code>.</p>
<p>You might already see where this is going now. Mallory pushed the malicious code under the name and email of Bob. When the “feature” was discovered, Bob was blamed immediately, and noone even thought about blaming Mallory (who didn’t work at the company anymore at this point) because after all, the email and name stated quite clearly that Bob committed that code. Gladly, Bob wasn’t fired, as he could assure that it was NOT him who committed the code.</p>
<p>Now, what can we do to prevent this from happening? It’s surprisingly easy. Git has always offered the functionality to sign Tags with PGP, but starting with version 1.7.9, functionality to sign commits was added. It’s very easy to enable, too. First step, locate your PGP key:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ gpg --list-secret-keys | grep ^sec</div><div class="line">sec <span class="number">2048</span>R/<span class="number">75</span>D697BF <span class="number">2013</span>-<span class="number">07</span>-<span class="number">08</span> [expires: <span class="number">2023</span>-<span class="number">07</span>-<span class="number">06</span>]</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Second step, set up that key to be used with git:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ git config --global user.signingkey <span class="number">75</span>D697BF</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>And now you’re ready to sign your git commits with <code>git commit -S</code>. Now that commit is signed, and everyone that has your PGP public key can confirm that YOU made this commit (or someone stole your private key, but that’s a completely different problem, and you should revoke your key immediately.) You can verify the signatures on commits like this: <code>git log --show-signature</code>. Since the output is very long, I put the output for different scenarios in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/sonOfRa/9649586" title="Git commit signatures" target="_blank" rel="external">gist</a></p>
<p>Does that mean that every Tox contributor has to set up PGP now? While personally, I think EVERYONE should have PGP, no. You can go on developing and adding Pull Request just as you did before. Only the repository maintainers of core, the bindings, and the clients need to worry about this.</p>
<p>And what does all this have to do with our Build Server? Currently, our Build Server fetches the latest changes from our different repositories and makes the updated code available to the build jobs, which then create a new binary each time the build is triggered by a change. This results in downloads that are minutes older than the latest commit, at the most.</p>
<p>Even though malicious commits are very unlikely, a malicious commit would also trigger a build on all clients, and until it is reverted, we would have built malicious binaries. In order to prevent this, we check the signatures of the commits each time the code is checked out. If the verification fails, the checkout will be marked as failed, and no builds using the unsigned commit would be made.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for the repository maintainers? Not much, except that they have to set up PGP and start signing their commits. There is one small problem, though. It is not possible to sign Pull Request through the Github Web-Interface. Therefore, we have to check out the Pull Request locally. Github has a guide how to do this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally" title="Local PR" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. Now, after you’ve checked out the Pull Request you want to merge, and it’s in the branch “1234”, this is how you would merge the PR and push the result to master:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">$ git checkout master</div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># --no-ff creates a merge commit</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># -S signs the commit</span></div><div class="line">$ git merge --no-ff -S <span class="number">1234</span></div><div class="line">$ git push origin master</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The <code>--no-ff</code> option is vital, because we need a commit on master for which we can check the signature. If the option is ommitted, the commits might simply be added into the master branch, and signing will be problematic.</p>
<p>Here’s some handy aliases so you don’t forget to sign your commits or merges, and one to view signed commits when using git log:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment"># View log with signatures with 'git slog'</span></div><div class="line">$ git config --global alias.slog <span class="string">"log --show-signature"</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># Create a signed commit with 'git scommit'</span></div><div class="line">$ git config --global alias.scommit <span class="string">"commit -S"</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment"># Create a signed, non-fast-forward merge</span></div><div class="line">$ git config --global alias.smerge <span class="string">"merge -S --no-ff"</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    </h1>
  

	</header>
	<div class="entry-content">
		
    	<p>In a time long ago Tox used cmake.</p>
<p>Cmake was first purely because it matched our goals, sort of. It provided a nice run everywhere interface that the average person who compiled the then build only Tox could use without issues. Cmake wasn’t all golden though, maintaining it was a sea of unneeded complexities and overkill, too much for the average developer to deal with for the size of Tox. While this wasn’t a major issue, one developer took it on himself to switch to autotools, with the promise that he’d maintain it.</p>
<p> Toxic starts to look all pretty</p>
<p>Our first client, the API test, was nTox. Not long after, Toxic followed. Toxic was pretty client in core, composed of a couple files and real ui, development on it skyrocketed. It wasn’t long till Toxic was a fully featured client, almost like the shiny new GUI clients in development. I had a crazy idea that ended up perfect with the timing, moving Toxic from a part of core to its own repo, Tox/toxic. When this happened, autotools were inherited over, as they were an accepted part of core.</p>
<p>That’s cool, what about the future of Toxic?</p>
<p>And now, the fun part. A couple days ago IRIXuser and myself were talking about the GSoC project on a replacement build system, we wanted something smooth and easy, without unneeded complexities. (We’re a dozen files and headers, after all.) We stumbled upon <a href="http://hypertriton.com/bsdbuild/" title="BSDBuild" target="_blank" rel="external">BSDBuild</a>, a simple build system based off 4.4BSD make libraries. A bit of look in to it and we discovered that it was easy. Like <em>very easy</em>. The entire system for end users was a configure that someone editing it generated and a Makefile made by hand. This was something our iOS developer could understand without a learning curve, with a quick glance.</p>
<p>4.4BSD? iOS? But I use Linux!</p>
<p>Before I go any further, I’ll take a moment to explain how the existing build system works, what users see, and how BSDBuild works. GNU autotools is composed of about 7 separate binaries and 8 files, though for this I’ll focus on just the ones Toxic used. To compile Toxic, the entire set of autotools binaries is required, along with a GNU make. A user installs all of these and runs autoreconf -i to generate configure. This process takes around 13 seconds. Afterwards the user runs the configure, making the compiled Makefile in the process. This process takes about 12 seconds. Afterwards the user runs make and make install, building the program. BSDBuild is based off 4.4BSD make libraries, built around a standard POSIX bourne shell and makefile. The developers provide the configure and Makefile, who are interpreted, and not system specific. To compile BSDBuild Toxic, a user installs zero extra files, as the configure is provided. a user runs the configure we provide, generating a Makefile.config. This process takes around 4 seconds. Afterwards the user uses make to compile and install like normal.</p>
<p>What could be so wrong with GNU autotools?</p>
<p>The design of autotools is an over complex one, composed of m4, marcos, and dozens of files and commands. This results in a slow and bloated install process for users, along with something that even developers who have been using it <em>for decades </em><a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1877" title="still run in to undefined behavior." target="_blank" rel="external">still run in to undefined behavior</a>. The result of this means that things like —disable-av being <a href="https://github.com/Tox/toxic/pull/100" target="_blank" rel="external">broken</a> go unnoticed, without support for things like —enable-debug (A BSDBuild specific flag we implemented with ease). From an end user perspective, this means a configure process that takes 9 times longer and lacks features, requiring more software installed.</p>
<p>But BSDBuild couldn’t be perfect, I mean you <strong>did</strong> drop cmake!</p>
<p>One of the major issues with BSDBuild is that support for checks (REQUIRE(toxcore) can’t be done without making them first. Thankfully, the design of the pm file used for a check is so simple, we had toxcore, toxav, sodium, and openal done in half an hour. Since configure is provided by us, this means no extra work for the end user. Now, BSDBuild does have some other side effects, developers editing either configure.in or Makefile (The entire BSDBuild) do need to have BSDBuild installed, in order to run the mkconfigure command.</p>
<p>BSDBuild doesn’t work on GNU/HURD, right?</p>
<p>Wrong! Something to consider is that while BSD Makefiles run on GNU make, GNU Makefiles may not run on BSD make. While GNU autotools produce GNU Makefiles, the POSIX compliant BSDBuild files are more supported on more platforms than the autotools equivalent, going as far as supporting making Visual Studio and DOS Watcom projects, despite Toxic not running on Windows.</p>
<p>Reactions</p>
<p>Reactions to BSDBuild have been mixed, while the autotools maintainer has made some rather ignorant remarks about the compile process with BSDBuild, stating that perl is required (It is not), we do forgive him, BSDBuild isn’t a well known system. A few people have stated that the work was a bit of a waste of time, autotools is working. We disagree with this ideology, something like this might seem trivial in the short term, though the ease of use will aide future Toxic developers and helping them focus on the code, and not the build system.</p>
<p>The last group of people have been supportive, these have generally been users of more popular and more exotic systems, from praising the easy debugging, to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;rhaps0dy&gt; so, uhm</p>
<p>&lt;rhaps0dy&gt; where do I get the BSDBuild version of libtoxcore?</p>
<p>&lt;LordAro&gt; rhaps0dy: there isn’t one</p>
<p>&lt;LordAro&gt; only toxic has a bsdbuild build system so far</p>
<p>&lt;LordAro&gt; and that’s not in master until people can be convinced that it’s “a good thing” (tm)</p>
<p>&lt;rhaps0dy&gt; :/</p>
<p>&lt;LordAro&gt; (which it is)</p>
<p>&lt;rhaps0dy&gt; I agree lol</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why isn’t this in master yet?</p>
<p>With a couple of the reactions coming from other developers who I do like, I would greatly like them to try the system out, explore it a bit, get some honest feedback. As of now, this has not happened, though I do try to push them whenever I can. As well, being new, the new build system may have a couple of quirks that we would really like to get out first. When the time comes I’ll merge the branch in to master, just not right now.</p>
<p>I encourage you to try it now, tell me what works, what doesn’t work, and most of all, your thoughts on this pending switch.</p>
<p>Testing it is easy, just do a new clone of Toxic, specifying the bsdmake branch: <code>git clone https://github.com/Tox/toxic -b bsdmake</code></p>

    	<p>Let’s just rename this blog to the Antox development blog.</p>
<p>Antox 0.6.5 is out and, like yesterday, with only minor changes that are mostly cosmetic. The total changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change receipt icons to something less arbitrary</li>
<li>Updated Italian translation</li>
<li>Updated German translation</li>
<li>Add Turkish translation</li>
<li>Timestamps of messages now update based on the local time of your device</li>
<li>Antox now waits to fully load the database information before accepting input. This may result in about a 1 second delay in starting the app, but it prevents force closing by a user interacting too quickly.</li>
<li>Deleted chat threads are now removed from the interface immediately<br>That’s it for today! Unfortunately, Google’s Developer Console seems to be down so it might take awhile. If you want to see the changes immediately without having to wait, you can download the<a href="http://vexx.us/Clients/Antox/antox-0.6.5.apk" target="_blank" rel="external"> APK here.</a> The update is signed with the same keys used for Google Play, which means it can’t be spoofed.</li>

<ul>
<li>A fix on the timestamp not appearing in the ChatFragment (pull out menu, where your contacts are)</li>
<li>Adding a missing space in the dialog window when you long-press a contact<br>*<br>Happy (An)Toxing! As always, your feedback is welcomed.</li>

    	<p>An update has been pushed to the Google Play Alpha Testing Group with a brand-spankin’ new APK.</p>
<p>This update focuses more on aesthetics, with most changes relating to animation-smoothing, notification polishing, and ActionBar backward compatibility. Delivery and read receipts were also added, but will receive a face-lift very shortly. To those who may experience Antox crashing when selecting a friend, re-installing the app will usually fix the problem. If not, please open an issue on GitHub and we’ll get it sorted out.</p>
<p>A new permission (Android.VIBRATE) has been added. You will have to manually update the app through Google Play, as permission changes, no matter how minor, require your approval. This permission was necessary, as notifications now have permission to vibrate your phone when the screen is off.</p>
<p>Thanks for being apart of the Alpha Test Group, your feedback is always appreciated.</p>
