Further investigation determined that the nameservers that powered the domain the nameservers were at went down, and after quickly moving that domains nameservers and a bit of DNS propagation service was restored.</p><p>So, what exactly went wrong? Tox’s DNS is provided by service X, behind nameservers on domain b. Domain b once used service X, though for DNSSEC support moved to service Y. Service Y was chosen because DNSSEC DNS providers are rather rare, and these servers provided faster response times. Service Y’s 4 nameservers were all taken down as a result of what we suspect was a DDoS attack, rendering queries on the nameservers for Tox useless. DNS glue was designed to prevent this issue, stop that catch-22, done by providing nameserver names and IPs in the whois record itself. This managed to get ignored by every DNS resolver, resulting in no queries going through. I was able to address this issue by fetching the bind file from X for domain b and deploying nameservers with service Z. After a bit of mitigation everything was all fine, with availability all around.</p><p>Service Y was chosen due to price and limited selection, though this later turned out to be a poor decision, service Z is a larger well known provider of Internet services, who offer a SLA, DDoS protection, and amazing uptime; at about 12 times the price.</p><p>At the end of the day, this was a painful lesson to learn. DNS isn’t something to be taken lightly, and is something we really do need to pay a pretty penny for.</p><p>Why don’t we run our own DNS servers? DNS is something that demands a level of maintainability, when something goes wrong fixing the server is difficult due to not being able to resolve the servers domain. This means more downtime, harder to maintain, and generally more expensive to run, and more messes like what happened yesterday.</p></div><footer class="entry-footer"><div class="entry-meta-footer"><span class="category"><div class="article-category"><a class="article-category-link" href="/categories/Uncategorized/">Uncategorized</a></div></span> <span class="tags"></span></div></footer><nav id="article-nav"><a href="/2014/04/27/stf-4-14/" id="article-nav-newer" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">Newer</strong><div class="article-nav-title">The State of the Foundation address, April 2014</div></a> <a href="/2014/04/10/sts-approaches-v0-0-5/" id="article-nav-older" class="article-nav-link-wrap"><strong class="article-nav-caption">Older</strong><div class="article-nav-title">STS Approaches v0.0.5</div></a></nav></article></div><div class="mb-search"><form action="//google.com/search" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8"><input type="search" name="q" results="0" placeholder="Search"> <input type="hidden" name="q" value="site:blog.tox.im"></form></div><footer id="footer"><h1 class="footer-blog-title"><a href="/">Tox Development blog</a></h1><span class="copyright">&copy; 2014 Tox Foundation<br>Modify from <a href="http://sanographix.github.io/tumblr/apollo/" target="_blank">Apollo</a> theme, designed by <a href="http://www.sanographix.net/" target="_blank">SANOGRAPHIX.NET</a><br>Powered by <a href="http://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a></span></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.css" media="screen" type="text/css"><script src="/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.pack.js"></script><script src="/js/script.js" type="text/javascript"></script></div></body></html>
