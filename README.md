Automated blog backup/deploy system

Changes made here go live in a bit under 30 seconds.

#####Notice to outside contributors:
New blog posts or pages submitted will **NOT** be merged unless the submitter has been formally made aware of that fact that his work will be added. This is done to ensure Tox blog posts remain something used by Tox developers for users. Note that minor contributions, gramatical fixes, and other improvements will be happily merged under the terms and conditions of the licene in `COPYING`.

## Working with the blog 

#### Install:
* install node.js and npm
* `npm install hexo -g`

#### Adding posts:
* Make a post by running `hexo new [layout] <title>`
* Posts sit in `source/_posts`
* Editing details: http://hexo.io/docs/writing.html + github markdown

You could just edit the markdown files without installing node too.
