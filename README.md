# Working with the blog 

### Install:
* install node.js and npm
* `npm install hexo -g`

### Adding posts:
Make a post by running `hexo new [layout] <title>`
Posts sit in `source/_posts`
Editing details: http://hexo.io/docs/writing.html + github markdown

You could just edit the markdown files without installing node too.
