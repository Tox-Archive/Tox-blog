It provided a nice run everywhere interface that the average person who compiled the then build only Tox could use without issues. Cmake wasn’t all golden though, maintaining it was a sea of unneeded complexities and overkill, too much for the average developer to deal with for the size of Tox. While this wasn’t a major issue, one developer took it on himself to switch to autotools, with the promise that he’d maintain it.</p>\n<p> Toxic starts to look all pretty</p>\n<p>Our first client, the API test, was nTox. Not long after, Toxic followed. Toxic was pretty client in core, composed of a couple files and real ui, development on it skyrocketed. It wasn’t long till Toxic was a fully featured client, almost like the shiny new GUI clients in development. I had a crazy idea that ended up perfect with the timing, moving Toxic from a part of core to its own repo, Tox/toxic. When this happened, autotools were inherited over, as they were an accepted part of core.</p>\n<p>That’s cool, what about the future of Toxic?</p>\n<p>And now, the fun part. A couple days ago IRIXuser and myself were talking about the GSoC project on a replacement build system, we wanted something smooth and easy, without unneeded complexities. (We’re a dozen files and headers, after all.)

The developers provide the configure and Makefile, who are interpreted, and not system specific.

It provided a nice run everywhere interface that the average person who compiled the then build only Tox could use without issues. Cmake wasn't all golden though, maintaining it was a sea of unneeded complexities and overkill, too much for the average developer to deal with for the size of Tox. While this wasn't a major issue, one developer took it on himself to switch to autotools, with the promise that he'd maintain it.\n\n Toxic starts to look all pretty\n\nOur first client, the API test, was nTox. Not long after, Toxic followed. Toxic was pretty client in core, composed of a couple files and real ui, development on it skyrocketed. It wasn't long till Toxic was a fully featured client, almost like the shiny new GUI clients in development. I had a crazy idea that ended up perfect with the timing, moving Toxic from a part of core to its own repo, Tox/toxic. When this happened, autotools were inherited over, as they were an accepted part of core.\n\nThat's cool, what about the future of Toxic?\n\nAnd now, the fun part. A couple days ago IRIXuser and myself were talking about the GSoC project on a replacement build system, we wanted something smooth and easy, without unneeded complexities. (We're a dozen files and headers, after all.) We stumbled upon [BSDBuild](http://hypertriton.com/bsdbuild/ \"BSDBuild\"), a simple build system based off 4.4BSD make libraries.

If every message had a different nonce this puzzle would be unsolvable.\n\nI'll start by explaining how crypto_box in NaCl works before telling you the solution.\n\ncrypto_box_keypair(pk,sk) generates a Curve25519 public/private keypair for us. crypto_box_beforenm(k,pk,sk) then uses our secret key and the other guys public key to generate a key using ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman)\n\nThe other guy also uses it on his side and gets the same key as us.\n\nSo both now have the same 256bit key that only they know.\n\nwhat do they do with that key? they use it to encrypt/decrypt data using xsalsa20: a stream cipher.\n\nHow does a stream cipher work?\n\nYou have a function to generate a stream of pseudorandom bytes based on a nonce and a key: crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k)\n\nTo encrypt a message, just generate a stream as long as the message then XOR the message with the stream.\n\nSince the stream looks random, the stream xored with the message will also appear to be random.\n\nTo decrypt the message, just use the same nonce and key to generate a stream then xor the stream with the encrypted message to get the message.\n\nNow, this is nice and all but how do we protect ourselves against someone modifying the message? Or someone trying to send us fake messages?\n\nThat's where the MAC (message authentication code) Poly1305 comes in.\n\nMACs are used to authenticate messages, by verifying them, the receiver\n\ncrypto_onetimeauth(a,m,mlen,k) Is used to generate a 16 byte authenticator that is appended to the beginning of each plaintext message encrypted with crypto_box right before being actually encrypted.\n\nPoly1305 requires that the key given to it is always different so it takes the first 32bytes that comes out of crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) (clen is always 32 + 16 (the length of the MAC) + msglen) for that key.\n\nSo, it generates an xsalsa20 stream 48 bytes longer than the message, takes the first 32 to generate the 16 byte MAC, appends it to the beginning of the message and encrypts the MAC+Message with the rest of the generated stream bytes.\n\nSo how do we solve the puzzle?\n\nnonces are reused which means the stream generated by crypto_stream(c,clen,n,k) is the same for all messages.\n\nThe first two packets are obviously the handshake (size checks out).\n\nThis particular python wrapper puts the 24 byte nonce at the beginning of each encrypted message and we know the handshake.\n\nSo we just xor the plaintext handshake with where the message is in the encrypted message to get the stream.\n\nWith the stream we can then decrypt all the packets that use that same nonce by xoring the stream with the encrypted message.\n\nRepeat that for the packets with the other nonce and we can decrypt everything.\n\nEasy right?\n\nThis is why every single message must be encrypted with a different nonce, so that a different stream is used for each message.\n\nFurther reading:\nhttp://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html\nhttp://nacl.cr.yp.to/stream.html\nhttp://nacl.cr.yp.to/onetimeauth.html\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly1305-AES\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce","slug":"how-the-crypto-tox-uses-works","updated":1420586788000,"excerpt":"","_id":"ej9hg7c55lewjeex","comments":true,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":""},{"title":"Antox Release 0.14.0-alpha","id":462,"categories":["q5mc6700pzozi6gl"],"date":1412373163000,"tags":[],"content":"<p>It didn’t take long for another release to happen but here it is, version 0.14.0.

This answer is a little more complicated.</p>\n<p>A friend (we’ll call him Bob) of mine recently told me a little story about how something went horribly wrong when using git. In git, you can set your <code>user.email</code> and <code>user.name</code> to arbitrary values. There is no way to check if the email and name you gave are actually YOURS.</p>\n<p>Now, there was another user who had push access to the repository, and they were malicious, as later discovered. Let’s call them Mallory. One day, Mallory decided to push a malicious feature to the git repository. Mallory was smart however, and so they did this before creating the commit: <code>git config user.name Bob</code> and <code>git config user.email bob@example.com</code>.</p>\n<p>You might already see where this is going now. Mallory pushed the malicious code under the name and email of Bob. When the “feature” was discovered, Bob was blamed immediately, and noone even thought about blaming Mallory (who didn’t work at the company anymore at this point) because after all, the email and name stated quite clearly that Bob committed that code. Gladly, Bob wasn’t fired, as he could assure that it was NOT him who committed the code.</p>\n<p>Now, what can we do to prevent this from happening? It’s surprisingly easy. Git has always offered the functionality to sign Tags with PGP, but starting with version 1.7.9, functionality to sign commits was added. It’s very easy to enable, too.

Now that commit is signed, and everyone that has your PGP public key can confirm that YOU made this commit (or someone stole your private key, but that’s a completely different problem, and you should revoke your key immediately.) You can verify the signatures on commits like this: <code>git log --show-signature</code>.

Not much, except that they have to set up PGP and start signing their commits. There is one small problem, though. It is not possible to sign Pull Request through the Github Web-Interface.

Github has a guide how to do this <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally\" title=\"Local PR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">here</a>.

C is the worst language to develop a lightweight skype replacement in. Compared to modern languages like C#, JavaScript and Java, C is an old and deprecated language only used by old men with long beards who refuse to update their old MSDOS machines to the much better and modern Windows 8.1. In order to become a popular application, Tox must be built with modern tools and not languages like C that belong in a museum.</p>\n<p>We have decided to rewrite Tox in JavaScript, this will enable us to make use of advanced web frameworks and base our application on advanced libraries such as WinJS and Node.js in order to create the best user experience possible.</p>\n<p>We have listened to those who say we have been re inventing the wheel and pledge to never do it again. As such we will only use proven libraries for the functionality Tox needs.</p>\n<p>Tox will now use i2p for the peer finding, this will also enable you to connect anonymously to other peers. For the networking we will use the very popular C++ Boost libraries to boost our application to a next level of performance and portability. Instead of NaCl (a relatively unknown crypto library) Tox will use OpenSSL, the standard library for secure communication on the internet. Instead of stupidly using the audio and video encoders and decoders directly, Tox will now use WebRTC for audio and video communications. Because of this, Tox will now be compatible with web browsers. Instead of the relatively new and untested ECC cryptography, Tox will now use good old RSA and AES for encryption. We will now use 512 bit RSA keys that are much stronger than the weak 256 bit ECC keys Tox uses right now. Tox will now use namecoin so that everyone can have a unique username which will increase ease of use by large amounts and solve one of the biggest issues that people have been having with current Tox.</p>\n<p>A huge issue that current Tox has is that it fails to sync conversations across devices, we will solve this by using facebook. Using facebook we can securely store the contents of all conversations and your contacts in a location that can be accessed using an extremely secure https connection from anywhere. This will also prevent murderers, terrorists, racists, pedophiles, privacy activists and other people that could hurt the image of Tox from using it for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p>In order to enhance the user interface, the official Tox clients will include buttons so that users can share the contents of their conversations on free social networking websites such as reddit and twitter.</p>\n<p>A significant amount of resources will be spent to create a Tox client that works entirely in the cloud. Tox will now be usable by anyone with a web browser and a facebook account. We now truly see that the browser is the future and that applications running natively on the desktop will soon disappear completely. We had previously though web clients could not be secure but realized that we were wrong. Encrypting things browser side with JavaScript served from a central web server is much more safe than using unsafe languages like C.</p>\n<p>To finance our operations, some advertisements will be added to every Tox client, the only way to disable them will be to compile Tox manually from source which will be very hard to do because we plan to soon remove the bloated build systems from every client.</p>\n<p>I must also warn you that we will not be using git or github to develop this new version of Tox. Git is a creation of Linus Torvalds, a very backwards man who thinks that object oriented programming is very bad and who hates modern safe languages like C++ and Java. Since we don’t agree with him, we cannot in good faith use anything he is the CEO of.

C is the worst language to develop a lightweight skype replacement in. Compared to modern languages like C#, JavaScript and Java, C is an old and deprecated language only used by old men with long beards who refuse to update their old MSDOS machines to the much better and modern Windows 8.1\\. In order to become a popular application, Tox must be built with modern tools and not languages like C that belong in a museum.\n\nWe have decided to rewrite Tox in JavaScript, this will enable us to make use of advanced web frameworks and base our application on advanced libraries such as WinJS and Node.js in order to create the best user experience possible.\n\nWe have listened to those who say we have been re inventing the wheel and pledge to never do it again. As such we will only use proven libraries for the functionality Tox needs.\n\nTox will now use i2p for the peer finding, this will also enable you to connect anonymously to other peers. For the networking we will use the very popular C++ Boost libraries to boost our application to a next level of performance and portability. Instead of NaCl (a relatively unknown crypto library) Tox will use OpenSSL, the standard library for secure communication on the internet. Instead of stupidly using the audio and video encoders and decoders directly, Tox will now use WebRTC for audio and video communications. Because of this, Tox will now be compatible with web browsers. Instead of the relatively new and untested ECC cryptography, Tox will now use good old RSA and AES for encryption. We will now use 512 bit RSA keys that are much stronger than the weak 256 bit ECC keys Tox uses right now. Tox will now use namecoin so that everyone can have a unique username which will increase ease of use by large amounts and solve one of the biggest issues that people have been having with current Tox.\n\nA huge issue that current Tox has is that it fails to sync conversations across devices, we will solve this by using facebook. Using facebook we can securely store the contents of all conversations and your contacts in a location that can be accessed using an extremely secure https connection from anywhere. This will also prevent murderers, terrorists, racists, pedophiles, privacy activists and other people that could hurt the image of Tox from using it for extended periods of time.\n\nIn order to enhance the user interface, the official Tox clients will include buttons so that users can share the contents of their conversations on free social networking websites such as reddit and twitter.\n\nA significant amount of resources will be spent to create a Tox client that works entirely in the cloud. Tox will now be usable by anyone with a web browser and a facebook account. We now truly see that the browser is the future and that applications running natively on the desktop will soon disappear completely. We had previously though web clients could not be secure but realized that we were wrong. Encrypting things browser side with JavaScript served from a central web server is much more safe than using unsafe languages like C.\n\nTo finance our operations, some advertisements will be added to every Tox client, the only way to disable them will be to compile Tox manually from source which will be very hard to do because we plan to soon remove the bloated build systems from every client.\n\nI must also warn you that we will not be using git or github to develop this new version of Tox. Git is a creation of Linus Torvalds, a very backwards man who thinks that object oriented programming is very bad and who hates modern safe languages like C++ and Java. Since we don't agree with him, we cannot in good faith use anything he is the CEO of. Therefore and also to promote synergy between our many developers, we have also decided to migrate our version control system to CVS. CVS has the advantage of forcing people to talk more about their pull request, thus streamlining our communications. We are sure this paradigm shift will help us push the envelope on Tox development.\n\nWe understand that this is a huge change for Tox however we believe this is for the best.\n\nThanks again for your continued support,\n\nProject Tox.\n\n**NOTE: This was posted on April 1 and as such should not be taken seriously.**","slug":"tox-a-new-direction","updated":1422148791000,"excerpt":"","_id":"pkk7wr65mftzttap","comments":true,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":""},{"title":"Tox Core and API changes","id":158,"categories":["nlwrm5tlcr1n8dpi"],"date":1395377465000,"tags":[],"content":"<p>Recently pushed was the api-fix branch by irungentoo.

Sean\ntags:\n---\n\nHello everyone. We realize it's been a while since the last post, but a lot has happened and Tox continues to progress, so there's a lot to talk about.\n\n##Tox core\n\n####core\n[toxcore](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore) has been largely in maintenance mode, with memory leaks, logic errors and other bugs being fixed every day. Recently work has begun on implementing a [new, cleaner API](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tree/new_api) written by the [Tox4j](https://github.com/sonOfRa/tox4j) developers.\n\n\n####Bootstrap daemon\nAs a small treat, the [boostrap daemon](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/tree/master/other/bootstrap_daemon) now has systemd support, thanks to contributor [ray65536](https://github.com/ray65536). It is also available as the package `tox-bootstrapd` from our Linux repositories.\n\n####New groupchats\nAdditionally, work is progressing on the complete [groupchat re-design](https://github.com/JFreegman/toxcore) and overhaul, started by [alnf](https://github.com/alnf) with currently being lead primarily by [JFreegman](https://github.com/JFreegman). Features include moderation abilities and group chat persistence (!). These group chats are currently a long way from being ready to merge into master; however, there is currently a properly [modified build of Toxic](https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/job/toxic_linux_beta/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/toxic) for Linux available with the changes. \n\nYou can also download the modified Toxic by installing toxic-beta from our Apt and Yum repos and running ``toxic-beta``. Keep in mind that this copy is totally isolated from your existing Toxic install to prevent issues.\n\nPlease be aware that this is experimental testing code that will not work with the regular Tox network until we've finished it and merged it with master. You can follow development on the #tox-groupchats IRC channel on Freenode.\n\n#Audio filtering and echo cancellation\n\nIt's been around for a few months now, but [uTox](https://github.com/notsecure/uTox)\nhas had audio filtering, provided by [code](https://github.com/irungentoo/filter_audio) from [WebRTC](https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/). [qTox](https://github.com/tux3/qTox) now supports it as well.\n\n####Experimental echo cancellation\nRecently though, [irungentoo](https://github.com/irungentoo) (project founder and lead developer, in case you needed reminding :) ) has created [some patches for OpenAL](https://github.com/irungentoo/openal-soft-tox) that allow for cancelling speaker echoes from your microphone's sound input, a necessary feature for using a microphone without headphones or earbuds. uTox quickly put that to use, and qTox gained the same ability yesterday. Note that, if you compile these clients yourself, you will need the patched version of OpenAL to link against to enjoy echo cancellation. The official builds of both qTox and uTox are both built that way, and if you need you can try using the [OpenAL builds](https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/search/?q=openal) on [Jenkins](https://jenkins.libtoxcore.so/) used for qTox and uTox.\n\nCurrently echo cancellation is considered experimental, and Tox is seeking testing and feedback from users (on IRC or [reddit](https://reddit.com/r/projecttox), for example) about how effective it is. If testing demonstrates that it is working properly, the patches will be submitted to the [OpenAL upstream](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) for merging.\n\n##qTox progress\nBesides continual minor improvements, qTox has gained the following major features.\n\n####New chatform\nOver the last several months, [krepa098](https://github.com/krepa098) had been working on a complete rewrite of qTox's chat form, and we're happy to say that it was finally merged into master in the last week (over 4000 new lines of code!). Users should see significant reductions in memory and CPU usage (though some problems still exist), as well as being much prettier and easier to use.

Users can now password protect their profile to safely transfer their profile to other computers, or even public computers. (Be sure to delete your profile when you leave a public computer!)\n\n####Compact contact list\nFinally, a lot of people probably love (or perhaps are unaware of) the new [compact contact list](http://i.imgur.com/tmX8z9s.png) option that qTox has, thanks to [lumirayz](https://github.com/lumirayz).\n\n####OS X\nA note for Mac OS X users: We pushed a number of major changes that totally reworked how the app works. Because of this, many improvements like Qt 5.3 -> 5.4 mean updating it normally will break. Please be aware that this update includes a new icon that you may not be used to, and has many visual improvements.\n\nIn order to update cleanly you'll need to re-download qTox and drag the app in to your applications folder like usual. Your profiles won't be harmed or modified in any way.\n\n##uTox progress\nuTox has been slowly receiving incremental improvements, primarily in the interface.For more details, you can check out the [commit log](https://github.com/notsecure/uTox/commits/master) or [irungentoo's twitter](https://twitter.com/irungentoo).\n\n##Google Summer of Code\n\nLike last year, Tox is applying to be a participating organization in the Google Summer of Code. Check back soon for updates.\n\n##Android\n\nAs mentioned above, work continues on Tox4j, the replacement Java wrapper for core,and when that's complete a new Android client will be developed from scratch on top of it. Another vague possibility is that qTox can be ported to Android, since it's written in Qt 5; [tux3](https://github.com/tux3) (qTox's primary author) has recently started the very basic framework of such a port, but it is currently significantly less useful than the old Antox.\n\nA fork of the old Antox is currently being maintained against the Tox4j work in progress. You can download it by joining the Google play beta or adding our F-Droid repo. Details on this are [here](https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries).\n\n\n##Website improvements\n\nWe've been continuously working to improve and refine the experience for new users by making things simpler and more straightforward. With this, we're currently working on a new site for tox.im and a new downloads page until the site is complete.\n\nYou can check out progress on the new site [here](https://beta.tox.im) and check out the progress on the new temporary downloads page [here](https://downloads.tox.im).\n\n###ToxMe improvements\n\nBy popular demand we've added a reverse lookup API to ToxMe. This allows people to look up DNS Discovery names using just a Tox ID as long as the ID they want to lookup isn't marked private. It is documented [here](https://github.com/Tox/toxme.se/blob/master/api.md)\n\n##Repository improvements\n\nIf you use our RPM repo you may have suffered some issues downloading Tox due to an old revoked PGP getting stuck in the signing process. We've gone ahead and fixed all the issues associated with that and ensured that it works perfectly.\n\nSupporting our new downloads page, we've gone ahead and made the qTox packages automatically configure and setup setup the repo on your system by just installing the deb. This means for normal users all you'll have to do is click download and Ubuntu software center will pop up to automatically set everything up and ensure you always have the latest and greatest copy of qTox.
