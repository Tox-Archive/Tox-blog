uTox is now the second Tox client to be hosted on the Tox Repositories, second to Venom.
If you haven't already, add our Tox repo to Apt or Yum by following [these instructions.](https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries#Repositories) It's a great way to get the latest changes to Tox clients in a quick and easy fashion.

32 and 64bit instructions supported; more to come in the upcoming week! (We're in the process of getting Toxic and qTox on the repo as well!)
