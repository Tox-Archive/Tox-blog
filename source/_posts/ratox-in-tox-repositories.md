Man, we're on fire lately. Ratox, a relatively new client created by the wonderful people at [2f30](www.2f30.org), can now be found in Tox Repos. Unlike other clients relying on GUIs as an interface to the user, Ratox is developed with the UNIX-philosophy in mind and allows complete interaction through named pipes. For more info, visit the [Ratox article](https://wiki.tox.im/Ratox) on the Tox Wiki.

If you're new to Tox, or haven't added our Tox Repository yet, check out [the instructions](https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries#Repositories) on how to add the Tox Repo to your software management suite.
