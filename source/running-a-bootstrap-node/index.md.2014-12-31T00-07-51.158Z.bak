Tox relies on bootstrap nodes ("Tox Nodes") to help facilitate connections to the DHT, and we need your help to keep Tox strong. By running as many nodes as we can, we make it even harder for third parties, including the government, to censor access to Tox. If you have a spare server, you can run a node that can help keep the Tox Network healthy, and resistant to censorship.

# How does it work?

Every client on the Tox Network that is using UDPÂ acts as a node, relaying information about peers its' currently aware of. However, users log in and out at any given time, which begs a need of a "bootstrap node", a modified, always-on, client that people can connect to when they start Tox. These nodes act as a beginner directory, and as an initial place to find other peers. By running a Tox Node, you assist users find other users. In addition, nodes will bind on TCP 443 and a couple other ports to help relay connections for peers, this makes Tox faster for people on restrictive networks or using Tor.

# What are the requirements?

Not much! You just need a server running a Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, RedHat, CentOS, etc.) that has a 24/7 uptime, with a minimum of a 20KBps connection. The hardest hit bootstrap nodes hover around 20-25 kilobytes (200-250 kilobits) per second.

# How do I get started?

With the [Tox Repository](https://wiki.tox.im/Binaries#Repositories) and packaging, it's now easier than ever to setup a Tox Node.

`sudo apt-get install tox-bootstrapd`

`sudo yum install tox-bootstrapd`

Using the repo is a great way to make sure your bootstrap node is always up-to-date with the latest improvements and security fixes, but for those who wish to compile from source, there's [instructions on how to do so](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/INSTALL.md#bootstrapd) on our GitHub.

Thank you for your consideration in helping Tox grow. Together, we can build a better messaging service.
